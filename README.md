Really had an amazing and enriching experience working on this project. I was genuinely so excited to share my findings and the methodology behind them during the presentation.

## Notable Learning Outcomes
- Design philosophies are dispersed and highlighted in bold to remind others attempting the same or a similar project of the foundations of design and the various factors to consider when exploring design opportunities beyond just the product itself. It is essential to remain vigilant for any potential aspects that may impact the design process and may not immediately appear as design opportunities.
- Despite containing fewer than 100,000 comments, our original dataset still presented significant challenges. Therefore, employing efficient data-handling libraries like Polars, rather than relying solely on the traditional Pandas Python library, proved beneficial. While perhaps not imperative for datasets of our size, it is also advisable to consider utilizing efficient data types and downsizing where feasible. For instance, converting numeric columns from int64 to unint16 and strings to categorical if they possess repeating finite values. Furthermore, opting for efficient and lightweight file formats such as Parquet over CSVs can greatly reduce storage overhead, albeit with a tradeoff in file-reading conveniences.
- Utilizing split terminals for parallel processing significantly accelerated our workflow. Running multiple terminals simultaneously allowed us to complete tasks in a fraction of the time, with the option to concatenate datasets afterward. This approach also facilitates error identification and resolution earlier in the process, mitigating the risk of losing all progress if an error occurs during sequential processing.
- Prompt engineering was also a critical aspect of the methodology. Ensuring prompts are clear, explicit, and reiterating information aids in obtaining an equivalently clear output. The ability to also prompt for and obtain Python variables as output, was extremely helpful, as they could then be seamlessly integrated into subsequent steps of the process.
