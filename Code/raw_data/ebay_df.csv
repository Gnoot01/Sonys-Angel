adben_9899,5,"Such Versatile Sound, Everyone Will Love These",Nov 20 2022,"Wow my ears have never heard headphones sound this good for $250.  They have a very wide range/soundstage and tons of versatility for all types of music.  If you're looking for a lot of bass these have that option that can be added and adjusted through the app EQ and bass boost feature.  If you're looking for a more balanced sound signature this comes pretty neutral out of the box, perhaps a bit warm but at no cost to the mid and upper ranges.  I would say these are hard to beat at this price, especially if you can only have one pair - these are just so versatile for so many different types of music and so many easy-to-use controls in the app.  The physical construction is nice but I was not impressed, it's plastic and a little cheap-feeling in the hands but it looks fantastic on the head and it's very lightweight and sits very comfortably AROUND the ear lobe, not ON the earlobe, and this will fit a large variety of head sizes for sure.  You really cannot find this type of versatility, in certified refurbished condition, for this price.  "
bluedra8570,5,"Overall, worth the $259 USD. It's a 30% discount off in my eyes.",Jul 30 2022,"Looks like new, feels like new. There were no oil prints on these headphones, nor any other feature that could've gave that it was used away. What's included is the headphones, two wires (USB C to USB A; 3.5mm to 3.5mm), and the case. The packaging was nice and secure; the headphones had really no way of getting crushed with the air cushion surrounding the case.

There is no manual, but that's ok. The manual can be found online.

There were no issues with pairing as I just made sure to charge it before I tried anything. The sound is nice, and there are no issues with the speakers inside. I did not try the microphone, but I had a quick preliminary test and seems to pick up noise at the very least.

The noise cancelling is good. I live next to a main street, and I can, by miniscule increments, hear cars passing by with some music. There is also air conditioning in my apartment that is—quite literally—cut out with these headphones. Even with them off, surrounding sounds are still muffled.

The touch controls work fine. The only thing I dislike is that the sound increments are too slow to move. It's also right-dominant, and it doesn't seem to be able change controls around. 

The mechanical parts of the headphones are fine too. Smooth in and out of the earcups and the turning of them.

Overall, worth the $259 USD. It's a 30% discount off in my eyes."
bilavideo,5,"Great product at a great price, sent with super speed!",Jul 29 2022,"I bought this for my adult daughter, a single mom who is working full time and going to school to give her kids a better life.  She loved it.  It's great for focusing when she has coursework or tests to prepare for.  She loves how its lush array of microphones allow her a nice transparency when needed to take phone calls or deal with issues that need her full attention.  She loves the deep black of the active noise cancellation.  It's lightweight.  It doesn't fold as compactly as the WH1000XM4 but the tradeoff is not having to worry as much about durability as there are fewer joints in the assembly to snap.  I got it at a great price, with super speed and in great condition."
jamdclegg.11,5,"life-changing if you have ASD, get overstimulated; ill-fitting(ish) for small heads",Dec 09 2022,"disclaimer: I've never had NC headphones so I have nothing to compare these to. 

Because I went from apple's wire earbuds to these, I'll let other people talk about the new&nifty NC features and whatever. For me, these might as well be a gift from god[dess]. I can actually work in public spaces now that I have something to block out small, repetitive noises, people's chatter, and song lyrics (which always make me lose my focus). 

I'm on the autism spectrum, so I'm easily overstimulated by noises. These have been life-changing for my energy and focus. I've started wearing them around town and in my apartment and I find it so much easier to move my body and concentrate on tasks. 

Battery life is great. 

**only complaint: they're not super comfortable if you have a smaller head. I fit the band and put them on as instructed, but they still feel a bit saggy/heavy on my ears. EVEN THEN, they're pretty comfortable. I don't start to feel noticeable discomfort until I've worn them for 2 hours continuously which is, imo, impressive. "
kelwy_80,5,Great product!,Mar 03 2023,I decided to purchase these refurbished XM5's since there was a return window and Ebay has a warranty if something were to be wrong with them. I was happily surprised to see they looked brand new. They were shipped well - the packaging protected them well and came with everything I needed. The sound quality is great and I love them. They are super comfortable and so noise cancelling I don't even hear people come into my house or into a room. I also like that you can adjust it to have the ambient sound if I wanted it. It is great for my work from home setup or for just listening to music/podcasts. Highly highly recommend this seller!
jlion310,5,Sony wh 1000X5,Jul 25 2023,The headphones i bought the sony 1000x5 are very good quality sound is great its features are outstanding i use them at work for hearing protection the ambien sound makes my sound environment safer and noise cancelling also i recommend these headphones they are very advanced 
holnugget,5,Bang for your buck!,Dec 14 2022,"First off, this was $200 certified and it looks and sounds brand spanking new.  This was a really good bang for your buck.  Sony makes a product that is on par with Bose.  If you are a frequent traveler, you will love these and they are very light.  Highly recommended."
a839741056_8,5,"not worth if you have xm4, but if u new ,totally worth it",Nov 16 2022,"only problem is i have wh1000xm4, not really worth the upgrade,
but if you need a new headphone, or want to switch from bose/apple/beats or any other brand to say, i recommend go with the xm5, instead of xm4

consider this is only $50 more expensive than xm4, its totaly worth the upgrade,
just aint worth a $250 upgrade from xm4

and to be honest, i think xm4 looks better"
liqwid9,5,Better than I anticipated,Aug 27 2022,Headphones work amazing well in the noise cancelling department.  Great for a noisy work environment in the office.  I mainly use it to take calls and it excels at that function.  Sounds quality and internal microphone work better than expected.
kain35,5,Elite Headphones,Jan 11 2023,"I love these headphones.  Music is great, the app allows you to shape the sound profile.  Calls are very clear in respect to both hearing and microphone quality.  Noise cancelling is next level."
commandershipp,5,Excellent Pickup,Oct 06 2023,"Does everything you want out of a Sony brand headphone and more. I found some of the auto options regarding sound cancelling and ambient passthrough to work well in most situations. If they don't, you can easily cut them off. So yeah, overall, very impressed so far."
illingwort0,5,Headphones arrived in great condition!,Feb 13 2024,"These headphones sound amazing especially with active noise cancelling! The fit is a bit tight at first and takes a while to get used to, but it is worth it! The case is also super helpful and has a compartment in the middle for the 3.5mm cable and USB-C charging cord. I would also say that you may need to be extra careful with these headphones at times because the plastic feels a bit fragile especially at the joint right above the ears where the cans rotate. Also these headphones do collect fingerprints very easily. You may want to put a cover or skin on them, but in my experience, they will not fit into the case afterwards, so you may have to choose between using the case or having no fingerprints on your headphones. Another thing is that the faux leather ear muffs may make you feel a bit hot after a while especially if your heater is running at home. But overall the sound quality is absolutely superb and the other aspects of the headphones are good enough to make these worth owning. "
dlurchs13,5,Happy with purchase.,Apr 30 2023,These are great! No real difference between these and the brand new ones I bought my daughter for Christmas. Very happy with these so far.
johnlandrum,5,Only TWO downsides!,Aug 15 2022,"Awesome in every way you can think of except two: The Active Noise Cancelling is kinda garbage. It only slightly ""dampens"" the sound. And the bluetooth latency is close to half of a second, I believe. The bluetooth latency is fine for me, because I would only ever use the bluetooth mode for listening to music on my phone. However, the ANC IS a problem, because it defeats the purpose of having Active Noise Cancelling in the first place. Otherwise, the sound quality is absolutely fantastic! I love the WH-1000XM5 so much!"
garmo2,5,Stellar Noise Cancelling with a Light Frame,Sep 21 2022,This product is excellent and extremely comfortable. The app is great and noise cancelling is the best feature. 
yux8719,4,Great product,Jun 03 2023,"Great product. Comfortable and easy to use. Noise cancelling works great. Don't know if it's a me thing but noise cancelling does put a bit of pressure in my ears. Also the detection for taking off and putting back on the headphones is a bit weird, sometimes not recognizing that it's not unpaused
Should note that this does not include charger or aux cable."
jac25278,4,Sound and Comfortability,Dec 08 2022,"Don’t get me wrong these headphones sound great. The noise cancellation is unmatched though I have heard better from other headphone’s transparency settings. These headphones are very lightweight but they are not as portable as I thought. You can’t really fold these headphones like you would the predecessor and the case is fairly large, but they are still none the less comfortable. If you are looking for top end zone-out headphones these are a great buy."
g-thani,5,Excellent pair of Headphones for everyday use and travel.,Jul 26 2023,"Pros:
Feels great (comfortable), sound is amazing, design and look are amazing, easily connects to phone.  

cons: Sony headphones app is very confusing, comes with a very short charging cable, controls on the headphone can get complicated since its mostly touchscreen. "
paulchang1129,5,WH 1000 XM5 is a great headphone,Dec 02 2023,"Sony WH-1000XM5 is comfortable and i can wear for hours without neck ache/or headache due to tight clamp or the weight of the headphone. 
It has great sound- the high pitch is sweet without hissing sound, mid is clear, and the low is powerful and well controlled. 
Bluetooth connection is quick.  "
desti.joana,5,Great headphones 🎧,Aug 15 2022,"I was reluctant to buy them since it is refurbished. I received them but and it gave me some headache during the update process. I was gonna return them. 

After the update, all my anger went away as it works better than I expected 🙃. The app is alright, the sound quality is great, and the battery life not too bad. I don't get the 30 hours more like 19 if I don't adjust the volume. "
sjc122870,5,Well worth the expense.,Dec 30 2022,"They have excellent clarity and volume.  I'm able to watch movies and understand what is being said.  The only issue is that I had to go through the online help guide and go through each of the settings in the Headphones Connect app to get everything working properly.  Since I am inexperienced in my knowledge of audio language and settings, it took me over a day to finally get it all setup to work well with my new Fire TV cube."
kylmcve_0,5,The Reviews Are Right,Sep 20 2022,"I’m not an audiophile. I haven’t tested all the latest headphones. I don’t know how to tune an equalizer to elicit the best possible sound out of every single song. But I do want the best possible headphones now, so they’ll be “current” as long as possible. All of that is to say I don’t buy headphones very often. For reference, My last headphones were wired. These headphones exceed every expectation. The sound is fantastic. They are comfortable and cool. And they are very user-friendly, once you know how to use the touch controls. I hope these will last a long time. "
3ix-83,5,As good as the ratings claim,Sep 24 2023,"I’m severely attached to Bose for all things audio. Twice I deviated and bought Sony products and regretted it immediately. After reading 4,000 reviews I thought I’d give Sony one more stab and they absolutely nailed it. Not super comfortable/get hot, but the sound quality doesn’t get better in this price range and the controls are totally intuitive."
mus_rj_ayooegag4,5,Best headphones EVER!,Mar 27 2023,"Fits comfortably over my head and around my ears. Easy to set up and start using. Sound quality and noise canceling are truly amazing. I would absolutely and without reservation, recommended the Sony WH-1000XM5! "
jef_piate,5,"High quality, pricey.",Mar 10 2023,"Unbelievable noise cancelation.  Nice sound, definitely glad I bought them.  Case is awkward and they do take up some space in my gym bag. Would definitely buy again. "
rngln-50,5,"Amazing, comfortable, right priced",Feb 02 2023,"A trip from El Paso - LAX - Sydney - Adelaide involved serious delays, in the end, I was listening to this product for at least 24 hours in total without discomfort, the noise cancelation was very good and the sound quality extraordinary, much better than Bose which I could not stand for more than 4 hours and the plane engine noise would leak non-stop. In addition my 3D, 8D, 12D audio experience makes me want more remixed material and for it to become main street."
lelui12cr,5,Great headphones for work and day life,Apr 15 2023,"This is an excellent product that I use on a daily basis. It is comfortable and ideal for making calls and listening to music. Moreover, it is highly convenient to use while traveling on airplanes."
adrian0502,5,Best headphones ever!,Oct 27 2022,I came from first gen air pod pros and these blow those out of the water. I realize they are different class of headphones but the noise cancellation on the Sony is soo much better. The design is really simple but still manages to look premium. 
ka805515,5,Good headphones,Oct 04 2022,Product arrived in perfect condition. The headphones has great bass and many other presets that will help you enjoy music. The noise cancelling is good but the ambient noise could be better. But other than that the headphones are amazing.
dawnlanddad,5,Does all as advertised by Sony.,Aug 29 2023,Wonderful sound. Very comfortable.  Can use during jogging.  Great battery life.  Excellent noise cancelling.  Wonderful phone quality.
merciless999,5,Fantastic Headphones Most Revolutionary Since Original QC15s,Nov 28 2023,I have owned different Bose and Sony headphones over the 14+ years and this is the most amazing pair since the original QC15s.   The clarity of the sound and the noise cancellation is absolutely top notch.   There is no issues with bluetooth connectivity what so ever.   Overall it is quite a qualitative jump over the XM4s!
pradyut,5,Best ANC and very good audio quality,Nov 25 2023,"Extraordinary noise cancelling, great audio quality. Still have to test on a long haul flight, but so far, very comfortable for prolonged use as well."

edwiozolin_0,5,Best headphones I’ve ever had!,Feb 24 2023,I’ve looked over different reviews of Sony versus Bose versus apple headphones set and everywhere I’ve seen  at the best reviews on the Sony itself … and now I got them in person and they are the best. I verify that for sure. I’m very satisfied!
yamwt,5,Excellent,Aug 20 2022,"In my opinion, the Sony XM5 is better than the XM4 in terms of ANC and sound quality.  However, I find it to be a tiny bit less comfortable than the XM4.  It's worth the price."
