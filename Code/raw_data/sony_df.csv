Only had it a week and am delighted with its performance
"The Headphones are amazing, but I can't keep them for more than one or two hours max because of the heat that they produce around the ears, so if you are in summer or studying in the library in warm places, including your house, it will warm up your ears too much where you can't keep it any longer for a while, unlike the Airpodmax. However, they are lightweight, but you can't just put them in your bag. They can't be folded or put on the neck (very uncomfortable); the battery is not how they claim, but it lasts long enough for a few days depending on your use!
The chat-to-speak is a very unuseful feature, does not work properly and the app is headiest.
I don't know if there is something wrong with mine or if this is how it's functions regarding the speak-to-chat feature, but it is brand new however, regarding all other comments, this pretty much what you will find.
The sound quality is amazing and responsive.
The noise cancelling is amazing!
For the price I paid, I believe they are a bit pricey as I think it is worth half of the price."
"Bought this couple of days ago and have used it everyday since im a uni student so i was not completley happy with forking out so much money for headphones but id do so again, they are brilliant, really amazing noise cancelling for noisy lectures or when studying in the library, the ambient feature where it uses the microphone so you can hear whats going on around you is so clever i honestly didnt think that that fuction would work as well as it does!
its also really good for when doing the food shop, i stuggle with loud noises and get overstimulated really quickly when shopping but the noise completly is blocked out and when its time to pay you just click the button again for ambient sound and its so easy."
The sound quality is exceptional - no wonder it's everyone's best buy.
After just one day I can tell that they were worth the money!
"Best quality headphones on the market, great sound quality and ANC"
"I’ve tried several noise cancelling headphones and I have finally discovered headphones that meet my standards!! The Sony wireless noise cancelling headphones are perfection.  Perfect for when you want to focus on your work, drown out noise, awesome travel headphones. They are so comfortable to wear, it doesn’t feel like you’re wearing them at all.  They come in a sleek carrying case."
"I just purchased and sound is amazing.
Just plug and play--simple."
"Pros: REALLY good noise cancelling. Good touch control features. Good app (if a bit confusing).  Reasonable battery life 
 Good sound quality. Very comfortable. Voice quality for calls is very clear. 
Cons: Expensive. They feel a bit plasticy and the joints to the cups look a bit thin. Sound quality is a tiny bit less bassy and thick than a competitor brand, but not by much, and the noise cancelling on the Sonys is streets ahead. 
Overall: really excellent headphones if you can swallow the price. I use 'phones every day so worth the outlay for me."
I bought this a couple weeks ago and I absolutely love it. It’s very aesthetic and the features on it are great. The noise cancellation is also impressive and it sits on my head comfortably
"Excellent noise cancelling properties and very comfortable, recommended"
"The sound quality is good, and the features provided by the companion Android application are decent powerful and generally applied without a restart, which is convenient.

However, the hardware is thoroughly disappointing. Firstly, the touch panel is only on the right earcup, which means that those missing a limb or simply left-handed cannot become used to this method of operation. Additionally, because it has so few backup buttons (for no reason – there is loads of space for more surrounding the cup) it cannot be used with gloves on or wet.

In fact, wetness is the greatest problem these face. They cannot be used in any kind of rain, or even a humid environment. It absolutely wrecks them temporarily – it produces the most awful sounds for the next few weeks, until it dries."
"Sony does it again, another quality product with features like outstanding noise cancelling and long battery life plus multiple point connection, highly recommended"
"I bought these prior to a stay in Hospital after checking  the 'Which'  website for 'Best Buy'  What a blessing as hospital wards are noisy and busy but noise cancelling brought relief  while an audio book of ""Slow Horses"" filled the days until home time.  Conrols on right phone need a bit of practice but 'stop' on removing the phones and 'restart' on putting them back on was very accurate."
"Sound great but made badly. One of the arms snapped under normal use. Sony refuse to fix under warranty and want £220 to replace a bit of plastic. 

Google the guardian article on Sony headphones breaking under warranty and Sony refusing to fix them. 

It’s a major issue with the design or manufacture. 

Avoid like the plague"
Noise cancelling is good but the other features are lacks for the price Google assistant picks and chooses set up overly difficult download this and that how come stuff can't just do what is advertised without having to pay extra for all features overall I think overpriced
Really happy with purchase. Sound improved from previous model and much lighter to wear.
"Preordered these, love the design, light weight, noise cancelling and the sound quality is very good. 

Let down by irritating crackle/ticking noise that flares up seemingly at random. Noticeable over some music but especially when you've got it paused. I really hope this is a software issue of some kind so it gets fixed."
These headphones are amazing. The sound quality they produce is astonishing. I replace my earbuds with these and realized very quickly that i was missing out! They are very comfortable on your ears and will fit on your head perfectly. They charge fast and hold that charge for days if not weeks. Noise canceling is a huge plus and works splendidly. Highly recommend.
"Had the headphones a week, been loving the sound and the fit and finish is a step up compared with my last pair of sony headphones the wh-910n. I never seem to get on with the comfort of sony sadly, with these the pads simply aren't deep enough for my ears, I get a sore spot along the edge of my ear where it is touching the inside of the headphone. It's such a shame when everything else about them is simply great. I would only recommend for those with quite flat to the head or small ears after my experience. Although I will be trying to make the best of them and enjoy what I can"
Love this so much. Love the fact you can touch the side of the headphones and the music stops playing you touch them again music starts. Only down flaw is the charging cable is short wish it was a little longer but other than that is are wonderful headphones. Good for kids on long car ride same as for adults. Came with a wonderful case. So you can't loose anything at all.
"I bought the headphones two weeks ago and I use them every day, they are great, the battery life is long, they are light, the sound is very good, the ANC function works perfectly. After two weeks of use, I haven't noticed any weak points or flaws. thank you sony for this"
"It has really nice features, such as noise cancelation, chat mode, transparency mode, connects to multiple devices at once, it has really long battery life, 3 minutes of charging can get you 3 hours of battery life. Do the software update downloading the app. It’s needed to improve quality sound when connecting to a smart Tv"
"Exceptional audio quality, effective noise cancellation, and comfortable design. With features like touch controls, long battery life, and customizable sound settings through the app, it offers a premium audio experience. The Adaptive Sound Control adjusts settings based on your location, enhancing user convenience. The only thing i would say, if we are in Speak to chat mode, we can't hum music while we listen music."
"soooo nice.... i  luv 8!#+*
objective: relaxation complete..."
"First of all, the product looks very premium. It's very comfortable when putting the headphone on my ear. However, the sound quality not great enough as I want it to be when compared with medium headphone which have same feature such as LDAC BT codex. Music sound stage some time is too narrow but the bass is outstanding. However, overall quality of the product is excellent."
I cannot number how many earphones I have tried over the years. But finally I have found the perfect pair for me. The sound quality is excellent. The noise cancelling is beyond perfect. Still learning all the controls but am well impressed.
Love the sound quality. Annoying you are limited to only 3 apps for spatial audio. Should be linked to Spotify or Apple Music as these are the most popular music streaming apps
The sound is SO good I am feeling emotional listening.  Easy to set up and great build quality.
Brought these headphones because my old ear buds got trashed when Mowing the lawn. These cope with the ride on mower no problem and you don’t even need full volume. Also used on plane when going on holiday and couldn’t hear engine noise.I find over ear headphones much better at providing a seal for the ear to block out any unwanted sounds. Also happy that there is no pressure on the ear that you get in headphones from other brands. Great quality. Very happy!
"These headphones are amazing!! The sound quality is top of the line, they're very comfortable, they completely block out noise allowing you to focus on only the sound coming from the headphones, the bass is amazing, and all sounds ate crystal clear!  These are wonderful quality, wonderful fit, and just all around amazing!"
I really love the feel of the headphones and the fact that they are so comfy to wear.
I purchased these a month ago and have used them to travel down to New Zealand.   The noise cancelling worked a treat on the plane and meant I even got a restful few hours sleep whilst flying.    Highly recommended
I love the sound quality I like it over my AirPods and that’s now officially nothing over these babies 😍
"The Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones make outside noise and distractions a thing of the past. This headset allowed me to zone in, and focus on important tasks. And when I wanted a minute to myself, I could feel the relaxation it gave me. The Sony headset has great battery life. I felt like I could use it for 30 hours or more like it says. It had great Bluetooth connect ability and good range. The headset audio was so crisp even at lower settings. I love the case it came with as well. I loved the fact I could listen to music and then answer calls with ease. This headset makes me feel like a professional without breaking the bank. I highly recommend them"
This is a really good headphone. Easily the best in the midrange market. It sounds amazing with and without the provided cable.
I was bought this as a gift to replace old headphones. The noise cancelling is great and the sound quality far superior to my old ones. I like that you can adjust the sound to your preference using the app.
"I was looking for a new headphones when I came across these. Sony has delivered a remarkable product that stands up to the competition out there. I couldn't wait to see how good they are and I wasn't disappointed. They are so lightweight and comfortable that I forgot I had them on. The sound quality is superb. It comes with a nice case to transport them, which comes in handy since they are bulky. Wished it would be foldable for easy storage or to carry around."
I bought this recently and have been using it at the gym. It has great sound quality and noise cancellation. However i have a smaller head and even on the tightest adjustment it  feels a little loose. I also think it should be made more resistant to water so i can wear them in the rain
"Bought these from Sony on promo. Easy to set up and fast to charge using my own 45w block.

Sounds great. Good balance across the spectrum offering a solid bass and listening experience. Would definitely recommend."
"Amazing headphones. The noise cancelling is so effective. The sound has lots of depth, punchy, very nuanced. Almost zero latency, and that’s very important for someone who can notice even the slightest sound delay. 
Highly satisfied with the purchase."
Fabulous. It does the job. I fall in love with this product every day
"Beautiful headphones, sound quality amazing and very efficient N/C. The design is nice however I wished they could be folded."
"I bought this headphone a month ago, the delivery was super fast, the bass of the headphone is so nice, i like how i the app controlling really helpful for me to choice the noise cancelling effects"
"Decided to take the plunge and pay a little more than I have in the past for some NC headphones and these have really blown my mind so far, they are very comfy and I am shook at how well they block out any unwanted noises ect, I have some sound sensitivity conditions and these have been in a godsend in blocking out sounds and noise pollution that really effects me. I am going to buy them in GREY too so I have a back up pair as LOVE them that much, if you have the spare cash then they are an excellent upgrade or purchase, I have had no issues connecting them via Bluetooth to all my TVs and other devices, only downside is that they are not water proof, other than that they are perfect"
"Thee came as a ""gift"" with the Xperia 1V - I already had the WH-100M2 headphones, which I use on a daily basis and am more than happy with - these surpass these in both design, connectivity and battery life.  The M2's 8 hour noise-cancelling battery life was adequate but the M5's, as yet, I have not had to charge up, after the initial charge.  The range and sound is second to none.  Charging via the USB-C is a dream."
"Does what it says on the label, very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time and decent noise cancelling. Nicer design than previous versions too."
"I'm so in love with the quality and slick design. The noise cancelling is something out of this world, I definitely recommend it, big time."
"The band elasticity needs to be tighter and the cup extension range greater to suite smaller heads (such as mine!).  Sound quality is very good.  Bass is most noticeable. Some mid range tones could be more audible (depending on tracks) which can be addressed by adjusting equalizer. They sound better than rivals when comparing in shop. 
Comfortable design but they should really fold so the case can be smaller.  Touch controls are pretty good and easy to use."
I got these because I need new headphones and I could not be happier super easy to use they are made out of high-quality products and has great sound can hear all the highs and lows when using and they also have a great battery life super impressed I highly recommend
"I bought these headphones wanting to upgrade from the 720N headphones which I like a great deal. After wearing the WH-1000XM5's for awhile and getting used to the new touchpad, I wasn't blown away but happy with it thus far.

However I started having issues. Starting with a crackling noise in the right ear. The only thing that stopped it and what was recommended by the Sony website was switching off the noise cancelling. That did stop it, but the main reason I went for the headphones I did was an improved noise cancellation. The sound wasn't that much better that the 720N so it felt like the main reason I bought the headphones was just stripped away.

I also had other issues such as the headphones randomly powering off and the touchpad not reading any input during random intervals. I also just don't think they were that comfortable, not sore or too tight, just not that nice of a material. So I'll be more weary next time I pick up a new pair of headphones, for now I'll stick with the 720N."
I bought this yesterday and I am so happy because of that.
"Bought these off Amazon looking for the best headphones with ANC and stumbled on these WH-1000XM5 headphones and ordered them. They have been working phenomenally until just recently when suddenly the right side started to cut out and sound was distorted. I tried resetting it several times but I still have the same issue. I haven't contacted Sony directly just yet because I'm hoping the issue will be resolved without having to deal with support but I may just have to call them and have them either repair or replace them. Other than that issue these headphones have been great from the  solid build quality although I wish it had more metal parts, the sound quality is great with solid bass and clarity and God tier active noise cancelation plus ambient mode is great when someone in the room is talking to me while I'm listening to music. I highly recommend these if you have the money and hope you don't have the same issues."
"Product exceed my expectations, unbelievable sound quality and product design."
Headphone build and appearance top quality. Great carry case.  Technology field leading e.g. tap function on right earpiece and voice interjection. Sound and noise cancellation v good too.  High price negates 5* as I do wonder if less expert models aren’t just as good for those with average hearing. Recommended but would test against other models to see if you can discern a difference that warrants the cost c
I bought these recently. The sound quality is okay but I am disappointed with the size (too big which I presume is why the noise cancellation is largely ineffective) and they are bulky to store if I need to when out and about. I am a woman with an average sized head but feel these were designed with people with larger sized heads in mind… I wouldn’t buy them again as I bought them for noise cancellation and thought it would be worth the bulk/ fact they don’t fold but they aren’t. Controls are a bit hit or miss - sometimes there’s a delay in responding to the control or it makes the noise but the control doesn’t take effect at all. Disappointed overall.
"I am BEYOND happy with my new Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones! The sound quality is absolutely amazing. I listen to many different genres of music- from Rock, Rap, Country, EDM, and more. They all sound fantastic! It offers the perfect mix of sound! 

When I am not listening to music- I also watch videos and listen to lectures. As an online student, I have to wear headphones hours on end to do my homework, lectures and more. These are by far the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned. I can wear these for 8 hours straight and experience zero discomfort. My old pair of headphones would start to hurt and I would need a break- but these Sony Headphones are so comfortable that I do not have to!

I also love the Noise Cancelling Feature. I am a Mom of a 5 year old and when he is playing it can be quite noisy. The Noise cancelling allows me to muffle out some of the surrounding sounds so I can still manage to focus on what I am doing. 

I am also impressed with the battery life! The batteries last me quite a few hours without needing a charge which is important to me when it comes to doing study sessions. I honestly do not have anything negative thing to say about these headphones."
"Amazing product, highly recommended. Love the build and sound quality."
"I was blown away by how absolutely amazing these headphones are!  I have had headphones and ear buds before but nothing has ever compared to these!  The noise cancelling feature is so wonderful and I have never heard it work so well until now.  It is easy to pair these with your phone or even iPad. They are actually very easy to setup and use.   You can also connect to Amazon  Alexa.  You can use Alexa or your phones assistant with the headphones.  The sound quality is out of this world amazing!  You can download the Sony Headphones app and even adjust the bass/treble, preset sounds.  There is a button for ambient noise or noise cancelling so you do have a choice.  They are so smart and detect when on and off and will auto power on/off.  They can detect your surroundings and adjust levels to what is going on around you.  I can not say enough amazing things about these wonderful headphones.  If you are thinking about these, go for it, you will not regret these!  I would highly recommend to absolutely everyone as everyone should have a chance to hear what high quality amazing headphones sound like!"
"Great headphones. I use them for work and to workout. They look really stylish and I love the colour.
The noise cancelling is brilliant, love the option of having it off or on based on a click of a button. 
Super comfy.
1* less as a few downsides:
They don't fold down - I knew this already but it is a pain.
If I'm wearing them for a long time I do find it can be quite tight on the top of my head.
If I'm listening to a podcast on Spotify it doesn't let me pause it unless I take the headphones off, then it'll automatically stop.
If you're working out and lifting your arms by your head then the headphones are really sensitive and it'll pause or skip the song which is a little annoying but I just take them off now when doing these exercises."
"My husband and I bought these about a month ago and we are so pleased with them.
We compared them with the similar model Bose headphones and decided on these.
They are very light to wear, the controls are simple, sound quality is great. All in all I would definitely recommend them."
"I am in love with Sony’s headphones! These are nothing but exceptional! 
They came in a case box that is perfect for storing when not in use. And it’s easy to store. 
The blue tooth paring capability is perfection. I was and continue to be able to pair once my bluetooth is on and the headphones are on. It is easy for me to also pair with my peloton and connects seamlessly. 
Now the noise…stunning! I cannot hear anything around me while I am working, working out or just listening. Perfect when I want to tune out my world and enter another one. 
They also fit comfortably over my ears and stay put! They are super light weight which I also love! 
These are better quality than the other leading brands and I will continue to buy this brand! 
Absolutely in love with these! I can’t say it enough."
"I am interested in good noise cancellation and less in music quality.
I had the WH-1000XM3 for several years now, and it got too worn out.

The WH-1000XM5 is less convenient: 
* It is not as flexible and presses harder on the head, so it took me several days to get used to it (I usually wear it for hours even without playing music). 
* It also does not bend so it is less convenient to take it with me (which is essential for me).

Its superior noise cancellation capabilities (compared to the WH-1000XM3 ) were immediately apparent. My neighbor is an amateur drummer and once I had the WH-1000XM5 on, even before pairing it, it blocked this disruption almost fully. In the WH-1000XM3, even with music, I could still hear it too well to ignore."
"I bought these a month ago after much reading, testing and research. My time researching was well spent and I am extremely happy with the quality and sound. I use with an Android phone as well as a high end dtac system.

My previous over ear pair were B&O which I had and enjoyed for 8 years. I am now using the new Sony and am thrilled. Looked at the Apple equivalent, which also had great sound, but in my opinion were too dedicated to apple products"
I got these headphones as a free gift with my phone. I am amazed at the sound quality and the noise cancelling. And they come with a sturdy carry case to keep them in good condition.
"Upfront confession I'm a 60 plus male with Bluetooth hearing aids who is missing his music !!

While my hearing aids act as Bluetooth buds for my phone/tablet the quality of audio playback is such that I was on the point of giving up on music listening. For one last go I acquired the new Sony top of the range headphones and I'm so glad I did !!

On unboxing  I was surprised by the sleek new design which is quite unlike any previous headphones I've used or tested. I was pleased to see that there are no risky folding joints which always worry me and while the carrying case may be a little bigger because of this I really prefer this approach. Togethr the cans and case just ooze class.

I always prefer to see if I can operate a new device without reference to a manual or online video probably to prove I'm not too docile but also to see if enough attention has been paid to usability. One long press on the obvious power button and the usual flashing blue light was on for pairing. Two second look at my phone and I was off and running. (At the same time I disconnected my hearing aids from the phone to avoid any clash). I know there are various controls available via an app but for my first go I couldn't resist just using all defaults.

I stream from several sites all at the highest quality setting but as mentioned the hearing aids just can't cut it.  From an ergonomics point of view the headphones feel a little bigger and as such happily enclose my ears and the padding is soft and comfortable.

My preference is for live concert recordings and the minute the music started I new I was getting a quite different experience and memories of music pleasure were instantly rekindled. I was picking out specific instruments and band voices which recently have just been one blurred noise. The other thing that quickly emerged was the external noise cancelling which hit home when my wife tapped me on the shoulder to say she had been calling on me. Ah the joy !!!

Over the next couple days I downloaded the app and tried the headphones outside while walking the dog. First things first. I found the app really interesting as I still think of myself as a technofile but in all honesty other than upping the bass slightly I can easily live with the defaults. I did however try out the 360 music settings with a 360 source which brought a quite different to the whole immersive concert feel and was really enjoyable. When I went outside for the first time I had a ringing ""be careful"" from my wife as I cross a few busy roads. While the noise cancelling made a huge difference there was always enough of a background awareness that ensured I never felt at risk. For the first time in years I was able to enjoy my music with an outdoor experience.

Call quality and periodic use of my phone's online assistant worked perfectly with clear and usable ease in doors and out.

I can't compare these headphones to previous versions to highlight key changes/improvements but for me they have brought my listening back to a level I thought was long gone. Thank you Sony."
"Had these as a Christmas gift, they are really good quality and the sound and noise cancelling is excellent"
"﻿These Sony wireless noise-canceling headphones deliver the ultimate listening experience. I was really impressed.

When I first opened the packaging, attached to the protective zipper case, there was a tag with quick-start instructions and a QR code that took me right to the help guide for the headphones so everything I needed to start using them was at my fingertips. Thank you, Sony.

The collapsible protective case that the headphones come in has a place for everything to be kept - cords and headphones.  The headphones are extremely comfortable on my ears. Usually, my ears are easily irritated by headphones so I opt for an earbud, but these work well for me. Not only is the sound great for listening to music or movies (I travel a lot so I'm often listening on a train or airplane), but you can make calls as well. They also offer a long-lasting 30-hour battery life paired with quick charging. In just 3 minutes of charging I can get 3 hours' worth of battery life which comes in handy when on the go. 

I am extremely happy with these wireless headphones. They offer quality sound without sacrificing comfort. Great product!"
"Firstly, I was impressed to see packaging which was minimal and could be recycled!  Product is nicely presented.

I have listed to various types of music. Using the SONY headphone app I was able to set the sound to match the music.  The quality of the sound is excellent and there is no ear ache when listening after many hours!  The headphones handle a great depth of sound and I noticed no distortion at any level.  Clear and crisp with good base when you need it. They connect easily to any of my bluetooth devices and like previous models they shut off when you remove them from your head.  The noise cancelling is first class."
I've been using them for two weeks straight and i can't get enough of that amazing sound quality. The only drawback is that the sound could be louder
I bought the Sony WH-1000XM5 last week but thus far I have not put it on my ears again because it has not moved the needle for me.
The noise cancellation on this headphones is awesome. I tried this feature while on a plane and so far i could barely hear anything. It feels light and fits me perfectly. The battery takes awhile to drain even with the noise cancellation in use. Awesome features with high quality. I would definitely recommend Sony - WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones.
"These are great for any loud place! Originally I bought these for the kids when we attend loud concerts or they need some silent time. The headphones do it’s job, that’s for sure and everything is pitch quiet. I like the slick black look and the simplicity of the design"
I got the Sony - WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones and they work wonders so easy to use and set up. These are the best headphones I have used in a long time I would definitely recommend
Headphones are extremely flimsy and one side snapped off in just 3 months.
"Like recent Sony headphones, the WH-1000XM5 come in highly recyclable packaging that still feels high quality and unboxing is a pleasant experience.

The provided case is compact and the headphones fold very flat. There will be no problem slipping them in to a small bag.

The headphones are light but still feel reasonably well made.

The fit is great. Very comfortable and sound isolation, even switched off, is very impressive.
The noise cancelling is the best I've heard and I'd feel very confident taking these headphones on a long haul flight knowing their 30 hours battery life, and comfort and noise cancelling would ease my time away.

Its not all roses though. The sound is competent and reasonable well rounded but there is definitely a closed in feeling that you don't get with some other premium noise cancelling headphones. At best, is steals the ambience from the music and the soundstage is muddled. At worse it sounds like listening to music in a wooden box.

I have another pair of premium brand over ear noise cancelling headphones that are about 8 years old that I find much more enjoyable to listen to.

There is a lot to like here and the sound presentation maybe to others taste, but I felt is was a little disappointing."
£230 on headphones I ordered two weeks and I am yet to own due to incorrect delivery information so I can not find my product. Still waiting on updates and proof of delivery from sony.
Got fed up of Galaxy Buds Pro constantly popping out of my ears.  You can never go wrong with Sony.  Bought these headphones and it does all that I want at a high standard.  They don't fall off.  They are comfortable.  Sound is amazing.  Easy to use.  Taking mobile calls is so easy and convenient with excellent sound quality for the person on the opposite end of the phone.  I have yet to charge it despite using them for hours.
"I wanted XM3 initially and years went by and there came XM5 which I gifted myself for my new job which had hybrid working .Its a life saver headphones for WFH. I never had any pain or any discomfort wearing them for hours for my meetings. I even cook or do my work while listening to calls.
Thanks Sony for such an excellent product.
You cannot go wrong with Sony."
"I got gifted these for my 21st birthday after request due to the research I carried out to find headphones to provide sensory aid as I am autistic and have misophonia, leading me to these headphones. Not only do they have incredible sound quality, customisation and a beautiful aesthetic but they help reduce my anxiety daily on public transport and provide noise cancellation that improves my day to day life as someone who is autistic and requires this element in headphones. I always find myself tapping my foot to music or nodding my head because these headphones envelop my entire attention into the music i listen to without effort, it feels like an experience not just a listening session. Could not recommend these enough and are worth every single penny. Thank you sony!"
Great headphones on a black Friday deal. Excellent noise isolation and enhanced
"Superb sound, I don’t want to take them off my head! Very comfortable and great features, excellent battery life."
Clear sound and perfect and stable connecties. Comfort webring for hours.
"Compared to my XM3s, these are uncomfortable.  Yes they are light, but they’re a poor fit for my ears and I’m constantly having to adjust my left ear especially.  The noise cancelling is also poor compared to my XM3s.  With my XM3s I can block out all sound, with the XM5 I can still hear some sound, especially at higher pitches - not something I want when listening to classical music.  I wish I had tested these in a store before buying :-("
"I've had headphones from many different manufacturers over. the years.  These beat all of them, hands down.  The fine detail, the expanse of soundscape, the comfort, the quiet, the configurability, they all add up to a very fine pair of headphones."
"Superb noise cancelling headphones with excellent sound quality, I wouldn't be without them"
"Thought hard about this purchase as I already own a pair of older noise cancelling headphones.
However the WH-1000XM5 headphones are far superior.
Great battery life, comfortable to wear and a nice Carry Case.
Well pleased with purchase"
I bought them to edit film they are amazing and are the best purchased I ever made.
"Love this product, however, there are a few cons that I just decided to accept. I hope that in the next version, there will be improvements. Despite having a much better sound quality, noise cancellation, and mic quality for voice recording and calls, there are a few things that seem worse than the previous versions. Namely, the design is no longer foldable, and the cups do not rotate in both directions (they actually rotate in an opposite direction from what users would want to when wearing them on one's neck); having a foldable design would be way more convenient for carrying it around in a bag (and having a much smaller protective case). Besides, I don't really understand the choice of material on ear cups, they constantly collect fingerprints."
"best headsets used ever.. i have been using Bose 700 all these days, but sony seems to have won the game"
I am using Sony since 2002 I just love everything about it.
Bought these a month ago used them a few times the noise cancelling is extremely good and the features with the app brilliant   Highly recommend
"If you want to sit in a room and listen to near perfect sound, blocking out a lot of external noise, these are the best. I cannot recommend them more highly. However, if you want to use these outside, or in the gym....there are better options. These are not headphones for active people. I had two sets of the XM4s, both pairs failed, one after just 14 days, I wore the last pair to the gym once. The XM5s now come with a warning, not to wear them in the rain, or if you are sweating, so am beginning to think that's what caused the failure in my old pairs. Fair, they're not advertised as active headphones, but wearing headphones to the gym is pretty standard stuff, and these can't really cope with it. Sound quality is amazing, comfort is amazing, I do really like them...but requires buying another type if you want to go outside!"
"One of my friend suggested to get one of these bad boys as ha got recently the xm4 and he was very please with .
I used to have another top brand head phone that the mic suddenly died after 5 years so I've decided to move to Sony this time. Didn't regret at all. Awesome sound quality, even can be a bit louder then my previous one. Voice cancellation is amazing, including the voice recognition.The bass is second to none that is pretty important for me if it's about listening music.Also very comfy, can wear it for hours."
"These are the best headphones I have ever owned and that’s saying a lot, as I’ve owned plenty! The sound quality is phenomenal, very crisp and clear. Noise cancellation is among the best I’ve ever experienced. They’re also very sleek and not overly bulky on your head. I would highly recommend these to anyone!"
"Recently purchased these headphones, they sound epic, very comfortable and intuitive controls, app is great for customisation and stats on usage a must buy for music lovers"
I bought these headphones in December for wife’s Xmas and usually use grado headphones myself but bought these noise cancelling headphones and the sound is excellent clear treble and deep bass well impressed.
I’ll preface this by saying I have 5 kids so noice cancellation is a passion of mine. Not only could I not hear my kids stomping around on the floor above me but I missed a delivery guy timing my bell and pounding on the door that’s how excellent these are. On top of that pairing is a breeze and they work awesome for gaming as well I was hearing every single thing. Sound is crisp and clean. Was honestly shocked with the noise cancellation it by far has exceeded expectations.
"Very impressed with the noise cancelling 10 out of 10 could not hear any outside interference, the lightness on your head and the softness of them on your ears, adjusting the headband sliders is nice and smooth.
The sound quality is brilliant, really like the touch control on the right cup for controlling the volume and covering the cup to pause.
Making and receiving calls is very clear no outside noise.
Listening to your favourite music is a joy as it picks up every instrument.
The other thing I like is when you take the headphones off it pauses the track and continues when you put them back on.
The case it comes in I really like, you don't have to fold them up to put them away, you just turn the ear cups and place them in the case.
Overall I would give 10 out of 10 for these Sony headphones another winner, I would highly recommend them to friends and family and anyone who is thinking of purchasing these you will be highly impressed by the WH-1000XM5 headphones."
Have only used for a few days but excellent sound so far
"My word what superb sound quality these bad boys offer, the LDAC really makes a difference. Not a heavy headset so i makes for comfortable long sessions without getting sore on my head. Just purchased the new A306 Walkman so when that arrives from the guys at Sony then i am sure it will be a fantastic experience."
"These headphones arrived last week and I find it difficult to put them down. The sound quality for the price is very good, and the light weight means that they are comfortable to use"
"Excellent sound quality and excellent noise isolation and cancellation. Lots of options and highly customizable. Very comfortable too. It's a bit warm though, making my ears sweat after using it continuously for a while."
These headphones have changed my listening experience whilst on the go-airplane and train noise retreats to the background
Love them.. my first sony headphones.. feel pretty comfy.
I Bought my XM5 5 days ago it so good and so premium
These are absolutely amazing and better than I have expected
"The 1V is perfect Sony. The XM5 are not, they have pandered to the mainstream and I think spoilt them. Love the XM3, the XM5 have great perhaps better sound quality but do not fold arguably worse ergonomics and the notification noises are awful. I'll still use them but they are a 4 and the XM3 are a 5. Btw just for the sake of clarity I'd have these over any other headphones in the market"
These Sony Wireless Headphones were even better than I expected. The sound quality is great and the noise canceling feature is one of the best I’ve used. They auto adjust to fit your environmental noise and can be optimized for your particular ear shape to give the best sound experience. I would highly recommend these headphones.
I can't say enough awesome things about these headphones! I have been looking for a really good pair of headphones for my workouts and these were just the ticket! They have VERY clear sound and work wonderfully; I just love them. The best brand I've ever tried.
"Sony has done it again. I don’t think I’ve ever tried one of their products and been disappointed. These noise canceling headphones provide 30 hours of playback with a quick charge time. The comfortable level is unmatched, soft leather. They have a beautiful carrying case so you can keep your headphones safe and protected. I can’t say enough good things. If you are looking for quality then look no further."
I just can't take it off. It's comfortable and reactive
I bought these a few weeks ago and am very happy with them.
"I have had these for a few months now, the noise cancelling is incredible. In class I put them on with rain sounds  and cannot hear anyone talking around me. The same on the bus with music. It is fantastic. The white colour have got pretty stained so that is not ideal. The only thing I would say is I didn’t realise they are not water resistant. So these can not be warn in the rain of any kind. It would be a good feature to add as weather is unpredictable… but otherwise I love them so much! I cannot workout how to change songs / volume on the headphones too but that is not much an issue."
Had these for 3 weeks.  Amazing sound quality.........
"I bought this product from last month and I am using headphone everyday 6 to 7 hours, after that it's paining. Just the only things which is painful. All over one the best headphone"
When I'm doing some movement like jumping I can here something knocking inside.
"I purchased my pair a few weeks ago and on the recent long haul flight the ANC just blew my mind. It completely cuts out engine noise. Not straight away but a second or two after you put headphones on, they completely eliminate the engine noise. The fact that they don't fold doesn't bother me but for cups turning out rather than in, when resting on my neck, I'm not a big fan. Overall a solid 5* from me."
"These are a fantastic pair of headphones, but going off all the reviews I thought that they were going to be life-changing. 

Truth is, I paid £290 off Amazon and think that was probably £50 too much.
Mucking around with the settings hasn't really d9ne much for me either; I either just stick to Vocal or Bass Boost. 


Recommend them, like them, but half the price would probably get you the same."
I bought this product last month and it is fantastic with a great design and phenomenal features.
"I bought the first generation 5 years ago and thought that I would treat myself with 5th generation version. 
They are better but not as much as I thought they would be. There are some retrograde steps in that version 1 would tell you in a soft voice when the headphones were turned off or on and when Bluetooth was connected and the 5th generation does not. 
Overall I am happy with the purchase it cannot really justify spending £380 again when the first generation version work’s really well."
"Awesome product, great design very easy to use. Worth every penny"
"Received as product reviewer - first set of over ear wireless noise cancelling headphones and not disappointed. Really pleased with quality and functionality. Smooth set up process - would have liked a quick paper overview for setting up i.e. charging process, on/off etc before launching the app. That said it all worked out fine. Great sound and functionality. Clarity of sound and automatic sound control adjustment brilliant - trialled whilst hoovering, taking a phone call (very clear to other person & not able to hear external sound even though I was sat next to a switched on TV), or just chatting to someone near by with speak-to-chat function. Great that the sound stops when removing headphones and restarts in exactly the same place when putting them back on. Love the lightweight case for transportability. Really looking forward to using when next taking a flight with all the headphone automatic adjustments."
"Good sounds, nice noise cancellation feature and the volume is great."
Stunning headphones. Amazing sound. Excellent noise cancellation. Great battery.
"These headphones are just outstanding. 
There are so many little details and features packed into them. 
One of our favorite is putting your hand over the side will dull the misic so you can hear around you. 
The sound quality is so good. 
Ive never had a better pair of headphones. 
The battery life on them is perfect for our needs and it last a long time. 
We love the built in alexa because we have amazon music so we can request a song or playlist we want with ease. 
Me and my husband both use these headphones. The case they come in is great and keeps them nice and safe. 
They are so easy to connect with Bluetooth and we love all the options they have. 
They are so comfortable and they block out the sound well, but there is an option to do the ambient sound also which is a nice feature. 
These are the best headphones weve owned and theres almost too many features and details to list. 
We are ecstatic that we got them."
"Bought this recently to replace my old Headphones (WH-1000XM3) and I love the upgrade in quality. The quality in sound is much better and the same goes with the connectivity - it's a lot faster! My only grip is that when changing sound controls e.g ""Ambient Sound"" or ""Noise Cancelling"" there is no longer a voice telling you which one is which. This can be confusing at times. 
Other than that Great Headphones with more refined improvements"
I got this about 3 weeks ago and am very happy with the product!
"these headphones are amazing! I was so excited to try them. My family and I are huge audio files, so this is very important to us. I highly recommend for those who like high quality sound!"
The headphones were good while they worked. They broke in less than two months.
So far so good. Excellent sound quality and comfort.
"I am happy with these Sony headphones, they meet my expectations for comfort and quality"
"I had these as a birthday present and they are so good at blocking out all surrounding noise! I can now listen to music, films or use my I pad while my husband watches football!"
Second time i bought a sony headphone. It surpased my expectations again.
"I bought the black one back in March and I absolutely loved it. I have the Bose 700 for 2 years but starting to wear down. The Xm5 was the best replacement however one main problem is that it get dirty very easily; fingerprints and sweat. But that just the blacks one. I just ordered the sliver for a birthday present for my friend, I know she will love it."
"I’ve waited several months to write this review to get some longer term experience with these headphones. Very comfortable to wear, the sound is great although I’m not an audiophile and the noise cancellation is excellent. I walk to work along a busy 40mph road and this latter feature silences all the traffic noise out. It’s let down by over fussy features like auto pause at the slightest noise, a not so great app and I cannot use these headphones on a Teams call in an open office environment as the mic picks up all surrounding noises.  But I’m happy to recommend them."
"My first experience of sound cancelling headphones and based on reviews went for the latest Sony offering.  WOW.
Very happy and would recommend to anyone looking for this sort of product."
I always go for Sony but these are class above the normal one's I buy and the quality is so far much better and controls are easier to use.
My wife has always been a Sony enthusiast for years. So I up graded her old Sony head phones to the latest and she has been loving it ever since . Loving me more.
"The noise cancelling feature is excellent - it really works!
Nice crisp and clear sound and the EQ presets/manual controls enable you to adjust it to exactly how you like it. Very comfortable to wear and the App provides an easy to use interface."
"I had these as a Christmas present and have been delighted.
They are incredibly comfortable and the noise cancellation is superb - up to now I'd had a cheaper pair made by another manufacturer and these outperform it by a mile.
There are features I've not had chance to put to the test, such as the adaptive listening one which figures out where you are and reacts to it, but the touch sensitive panel control and the automatic switching to 'ambient' when you speak are brillaint."
"Look no further for your new headphones, these are it.  Unboxing alone is a treat with these headphones.  Throw the box in the recycle bin and you're good to go.  It is a little sad to see no quick start guide with the included paperwork however.  The quick start guide is now a QR code on the box containing the legal paperwork (which is only two sheets, so it's not that much).  The headphone case has a nice feel to it and has a nice magnetized compartment for holding the USB-C cable as well as an aux. cable.  The USB-C cable is actually rather sad because it is only a 6"" long cable that will really only get you by in a pinch.  The compartment in the case is rather small, so I assume 6"" is the best fit, and you most likely already have a good USB-C charger, so having this stowed away for emergency use is probably the best idea.  Aside from that, you are treated to the main course - the head phones themselves.

I work in an office environment and tend to wear my headphones for ~6-8 hours a day while at my desk.  These things are a dream.  They are super lightweight and, while noticeable, certainly aren't a burden on my head.  The cushioning is super soft and very pleasant on the head and ears. The finish on these headphones is a nice matte black - however, it is very prone to smudges and markings especially with any amount of grease or any residue on your hands/fingers (so make sure you wash your hands!).  Turning on the headphones brings me into a completely new environment.  I have a constant ~50 dB fan blowing behind me in my office and while I can still head it through the ANC it's only barely there - and that's with no audio playing in the headphones.  Gone are the sounds of the AC/Heater and any footsteps or quiet talking in the halls.  And then you get audio playing and everything in your room completely disappears to the sounds coming from your headphones.  The ANC on these is amazing.  There is no white noise that the headphones create when cancelling the sound like other ANC headphones.  They really are next level.  And the audio is really good with the headphones.  I am no audiophile, but I feel like the sound is a little closed, otherwise, everything sounds great.

On the other end of the spectrum is the ambient mode.  It's not as good, unfortunately.  When using strictly the ambient mode loud clicks in the environment will make an ugly popping sound in the headphones - I don't think this is intentional, but it seems like this only happens with high frequency sounds (mine came from a multi-tool deploying and locking a tool).  The ambient quality is also a bit grainy.  With this is the speak-to-chat feature (deployable through the app).  This works as intended and is a nice to have feature.  It completely pauses the music and switches to ambient mode when it detects your voice.  It might be best to have the option to quiet the music instead of completely pausing it which comes to the next point.  Covering the right ear quiets the music and temporarily switches to ambient mode - this is perfection.  It allows you to hold a conversation while keeping your music playing in the background.  Awesome feature.

The touch controls on this are finally a set of touch controls that I like.  Double-tap to play/pause, swipe up/down for volume up/down, forward and back for next/previous song.  Simple, easy, and intentional.  The double-tap for play/pause is especially a nice touch as it negates an accidental touch as an input or adjusting your headphones as an input.

Overall, these are fantastic headphones and definitely a pair that you should pick up.  There is a reason for 4/5 starts, though - they can be better.  While ANC is amazing, ambient isn't as good.  The app has potential to make a lot of different customizations available as well.  There are things to improve, but overall, a great set that is worth being on your head."
Best headphones I've ever used. Great sound and very helpful features.
"Had XM4 first and now XM5. Love 'em both but there was an issue with headphones touch pad first and them some problems with charging the XM5. The first problem with the touch pad sounds being on although you turned them off from the app was fixed with software update and the latter just disappeared after a few days.
Sound and noise cancelling is very good imo."
"very good gets a bit dirty quickly tho, oil can get on"

"I have been using Sony wireless headphones for the past 15 years & they have given me reliable service with good quality sound. They aren’t noise cancelling so I was looking forward to trying their latest noise cancelling headphones from Sony. Would they be worth the money?

Removing them from the cardboard box the first thing that impressed me was the slim but sturdy travel case they are supplied with. As I travel quite a lot, this case is slim enough to fit into a rucksack or glovebox of a car. The case unzips to reveal the headphones very secure in the case, it has moulded & padded sections to hold the headphones in place securely with a hinged lid that reveals a small compartment to hold the two leads supplied with them. Nice attention to detail. 

As you lift them out of their case you realise that Sony have thankfully designed them to be lightweight without them feeling cheap. In fact the build quality is first class, as you would expect from the Sony brand. Place them on your head & the swivel headed ear pieces fit perfectly & are very comfortable to wear. These are headphones you could wear for hours without any issues. 

There are two controls on one ear piece, the power button & the control to switch on / off the noise cancelling function. Two other sockets are discreetly on each ear piece, all very neat. 
I downloaded the Sony app to my phone & within seconds had the facility to connect  to Bluetooth which was very quickly connected to my iPhone. You could have went straight to the phone settings but I wanted to try the app. Later, I also connected it to an iPad & once again the speed of connection was instant. 

I chose to listen to Elton John’s 1973 album Goodbye yellow brick road as it’s ideal for listening to with headphones on & an album I’m familiar with. The sound quality is simply outstanding with perfect quality of sound, the noise cancelling facility works so well which in turn enriched the whole experience. 

I have been using these headphone for three days solid & have yet to charge the battery. Sony boast 30 hours of charge & judging my other Sony headphones with their constant long charge I would think these ones will exceed expectations. 

Gripes? Just one, the print on the instructions is quite difficult to read & don’t give you details on all the controls although they are on the website. It would be better transferring the basic instructions to the app & doing away with the basic instructions.

Conclusion, if you are looking for good quality noise cancelling headphones, in particular ones that you wish to travel with, these headphones should be the top of your wanted list. I am seriously impressed & highly recommend them. Worth the money? I'm convinced they are.

"These are totally amazing and it completely changes the way I listen to my music! Clarity and awesome sound, I love them! Easy to use and hook up through Bluetooth, comes with everything you will need to hook into your music experience! Highly recommend to others to get and use for oneself or loved ones!"
"my boyfriend bought me the Sony wh 1000 XM5 noise-canceling headphones, even though I asked him to buy the Apple Pink rose AirPods Max- Pro. He said that the Apple headphones are overpriced and that Apple isn't a brand known for making high-quality headphones. He convinced me to order the Sony headphones because he lost his last year while traveling on a flight. I'm happy with my new headphones, but I have a small issue with keeping them clean. The Sony headphones I have are white, and since I always wear makeup, my foundation tends to get on the headphones and make a mess."
"I was really looking forward to these being great, sadly when making voice calls people could not hear me. Tried a number of different settings and didn’t get better. Faulty headphones"
"I treated myself to these after reading many positive reviews in the tech magazines like What HiFi, Stuff and T3 as I wanted some over ear headphones as I don’t get on with in-ear ones. Sure they are expensive but you certainly get what you pay for, the audio quality is superb and I am so impressed, music I have listened to for years suddenly has new textures and details. The touch controls are brilliant, my only gripe personal to me is that they can feel slightly uncomfortable after a while when wearing glasses with pressure on the frames. That aside highly recommended."
"Noise cancelling and sound quality both amazing, no doubt best on the market and better than Bose 700 which I had before purchasing these. What is a bit worse than Bose 700 is the fact that when wearing continuously for several hours, right ear starts hurting."
Headphones brought for my 70th birthday by my son used them for the first time on a flight to Denver
"I spend all day every day on MS Teams calls on a work Windows 10 Surface laptop. TheWH-1000XM5 were bought to solve a need for a bluetooth noise cancelling headset in a busy and noisy office environment. And they did not work, and then they did and then they didn’t. When they worked - one word describes the experience - brilliant but when they didn’t - it was a nightmare - I was stuck with headphones and no microphone. Even more frustrating I found that the headphones worked flawlessly with my Apple products (iphone, Mac and Apple TV) which somehow made the situation even worse. The solution turned out to be very simple - uninstall (not delete) all the bluetooth and audio drivers and then restart the windows 10 surface laptop and et voila - they worked first time and have done ever since. I listen to more music, get more enjoyment from doing so and they work great for the job I bought them for. I just wish that there was something on a Sony Support page that had suggested I try that first. I’m sure I am not the first person to have this experience and so sharing this here in tth hope that a support guy reads it and writes the two minute knowledge article that I was looking for before wasting a week trying to root cause the problem myself. If I had not stumbled on the solution these products would have been returned as unusable. All because the support pages don't recognise the use case of headset vs headphones and the problems that drivers can cause. It's your shareholder money you are wasting."
I bought this after Xmas but I have had episodes of the left cup heating up when I’ve left it on my desk.
"In terms of NC is almost close to perfection. I don't like the plastic material used because it gives the impression of weak material. My second option would be the fruit company one just because of the material (but I don't think they are different in the final purpose which is sound quality), however, is double the price."
"The surface of the arch that fits your head is very thin, this looks good, but it makes it so that the point of contact in your head is minimal. Since only a small part of this surface touches your head, there is a lot of pressure on it, and after an hour, the top of my head starts hurting, and I have to move the ring around throughout the day to avoid this pain, which is very annoying.

The headphone comes with sensors which detect if you have them on. It comes with an app where you can choose if to turn the headphones off when you take them off your head by using the sensor. This is amazing for saving batteries meaning you don't have to charge them often because you forgot to turn them off manually. The problem is you can choose a timer for the to turn off and turn off immediately after taking them off, making it very annoying when you want to take your headphones off for multiple reasons like going to the toilet, talking to someone else or simply moving them around to find a more comfortable position, they turn off and if you are in a meeting on slack or teams, skype you will have to go through the process of connecting a device to these apps again which is very annoying. 

On top of that, I like to put a hoodie on and the headphones on top simply because it makes me feel warm, but the sensor picks that I am not wearing the headphones properly and turns them off; this is super annoying too. 

The only solution is to turn the feature which turns the headphones off automatically and remember to turn them off manually myself which I always forget and end up having to charge them more often than I would like to. 

The solution would be to let us put a timer when they should turn off so I could conveniently set them up to turn after 5 minutes of having them off, but alternatively only allow them to turn off if there is no audio playing. This would make it so that I can take them off for short periods of time without having them turned off and so that I could wear them however I want them without turning them off as long as I am listening to music or on a call with someone else. 

The problem with the small contact point and the pain at the top of my head, well this is a design flaw and I do find myself not wearing them often on purpose if I don't have to due to the discomfort and instead play my laptop speakers. 

The noise cancelling and audio quality is superb and the ambient mode is decent. I have 10 days to keep them or return them, and I am leaning more towards returning them. Will see."
"These are simply amazing quality headphones. Sound quality is just perfect. The separation between the bass, middle amd treble is just so clear and well balanced. Super comfortable. Cannot recommended then highly enough."
"I used the XM5’s on a 6 hour flight and then a 10 hour flight and they were better than expected at cancelling out the noise and the sound is crisp too!
Very good value for money with all that it offers."
"I own the XM3 and now the XM4
I came from the XM3 to the XM5. I had the XM5 on my head for one hour and the impression made on my head is as shown on the photos. The headband was not pressed down hard. Perhaps this is an allergic reaction to the material.
The ear pads are thinner than both the XM3 and XM4. I cannot say for certain if they would have become very uncomfortable after wearing for a long time becuase I never had the headphones on for a long time.
The sound was great but unsure if I would consider them better than the XM3 or XM4. I had high hopes for the XM5 but I am very disappointed. I returned them to Sony for a full refund. Thanks for that"
"Great sound quality, lots of cool features, and the best design. I bought the white ones, and they look really aesthetic."
"I just couldn't wait to buy the Sony headphones. Its great, its wonderful. I love every moment using it. 
The only issue is that is the headphones are not water resistant. I wish it was..:( So, you might not be able to use it for gym. I'm trying to find a good sweat resist earpads for my headphones right now."
I'm very happy with this headphones  the sound is real and immersive
"The connection to my new Sony headphones via Bluetooth was extremely easy, the headphones themselves ooze quality and are comfortable, even when worn for long periods of time, this is probably helped by there light weight. The sound quality is out-standing and even when listening to an audio book in a very noisy environment, the noise cancellation works very well, letting you hear just what you want to hear, even the carry case is well designed. So these get a rare 5 stars from me."
Just brilliant headphones better that the AirPod Max that I was thinking of buyibb
"For this price I was expecting seamless integration with Sony products, not the case.  Packaging poor.  After a couple of weeks using the headset I generally see no value and the quality of the sound is dependent on the source."
"Sony WH-1000XM5
Wow what a phenomenal product! Having read all the publicity material about this product,
what it didn’t make clear, was the breadth of opportunity to fine tune your listening using a very well designed app downloaded to your smartphone. Connection to all my devices laptop, pc and smartphone was very easy and the soft ear shells are so light and comfortable.
I have only had the unit for a couple of weeks but the performance using both Bluetooth and the connecting cable is excellent. Re-charging the unit battery is necessary if you choose to maximise the use the noise cancelling feature and the voice assist functions. Charging is quick and a good battery power up time is confirmed. The voice guidance was a pleasant surprise when my battery needed charging.
Connecting to multiple devices is easy using the app. By using the comprehensive online “Help Guide” and the “Headphones Connect app”, I have been able to troubleshoot issues caused by my setting experimentation! There is so much more to enjoy and explore for me. This product will change your listening pleasure taking account of your location with any background noise whilst linked to multiple devices. I recommend this product."
Technical Specification says the product should have been supplied with two cables: 1 USB-C (20 cm) and 1 Headphone cable (1.2m). Both missing. Sony requires that we use only the supplied cables with this product so what am I supposed to do? The product itself is excellent by the way.
"I'm happy with these headphones. However the registration process and in particular the insane captcha are beyond frustrating. 
Every time I go to register a product I forget that all Sony's legacy individual user IDs and passwords haven't really been rationalised and it will likely take 2 or 3 attempts to stumble on the right one. Sort it out Sony!
Meanwhile the captcha uses imaged that are very difficult to discern the correct orientation for (what is the front and back of a chair? Wrong!)"
i bought 2 weeks ago and i am not satisfied with the sound qulity and noice cansellation
"Upgrade on XM4. Very light and comfortable, ear cushions feel much softer than XM4. Ban slightly narrower but no issues as so light. Noise Cancelling seems better at high frequency but yet to fully test. Sound excellent. Microphones better according to those I have called."
I treated myself to these headphones when heading off on holiday. In combination with my sony phone they are exceptional. Firstly they are truly Noise Cancelling. I first tried the out sitting in a busy airport paackex with travellers. Instantly all noise was cut out. Sony's claims that their ldac software upgrades the Bluetooth experience to give high quality sound from hi-res files is well founded especially when used with Sony's dsee settings. Very impressed.
"Received as birthday gift.  Really great sound, very comfortable and the noise cancelling is very effective."
"Cracking ear buds, great sound, great bass, comfortable fit with extra sizes a great addition. Slight issue with creating an account but easy over come."
"I bought these after long contemplation, as I already was using a pair of jbl headphones. But now I own the Sony headphones there’s no going back"
"I've had the headphones about 6 months. On the good side, the noise cancelling is fantastic when it works correctly, better than any headphones I've had previously including Bose QC35. The sound quality is good (maybe could use a bit more bass) and they're excellent for phone calls. Connection to a phone is very solid and even the app is good. But there are faults too. First and worst is a rustling, rubbing sound in the R earcup that occurs randomly when using NC. This is a known fault widely discussed on forums to which Sony have not supplied a solution. It's unbearable when it occurs and you have to turn NC off and hope for the best next time you turn them back on. Second, they look and feel a bit lightweight and cheap for the rather hefty price. But they are comfortable to wear. A good product, but that NC bug is a big one and needs fixing!"
"I've had these for a couple of weeks now. I read many reviews before I got them
They are very nice and the sound quality is very good indeed. The noise cancelling is very good although Of note if I am to be very picky I can still hear if someone is next to me and talking if my music is not very loud but I was expecting this as some of the reviews did suggest this.  but it does stop me from hearing the TV for example if someone else is watching something and I need to focus on work. Overall very happy that I got these they have been life changing for studying"
"Very good sound love the feel of the head phones ,mainly used for loving old memories and listening to classical music,very pleased with them although when my family was here I could here them although I had the headphones on."
"Have previously had wh1000xm 2 and 3 both of which are excellent. These are just great, very comfortable and brilliant sound."
"I love these headphones, they have amazing sound quality and the battery life is great. the noise cancelling is great and works extremely well."
"I bought one of my daughters these WH-1000XM5 headphones and she loves them. Not only are the sound quality and noise cancellation excellent, but when she used them for phone calls while walking alongside a busy road in windy conditions, she sounded as if she were in a quiet room. We each have a set of these phenomenal headphones now."
I bought these headphones last week and they are very good. They are easy to use and very comfortable. I haven’t managed to connect them to my Sony Bravia TV yet but I am hopeful I can. The only downside was that there are no instructions on how to use them in the box and what there was is in very tiny writing so I think the target market is young people not us older folk.
"I was always sceptical about wireless headphones in general as their frequency response over BT was always poor.

However these paired with my Xperia 1 V and it's quite honestly a fantastic audio experience.
Even when i've been used to listening through some MDR-1R's for years.

To add the noise cancelling is great, another feature i always thought would be more of a gimmick but that is not the case. It blocks out an amazing amount of external sounds."
Amazing noise cancellation and super light weight .
"Great sound quality though I was disappointed that they are not even a little bit waterproof. I am going to have to limit them to being for indoor use only given the unpredictable winter weather. The intuitive controls are great. I have however noticed that the Bluetooth drops out sometimes with no discernible reason and I have to reconnect which is annoying. The range on them is great, much better than my WH-C510's. The material used for the headphones feels divine so I can only assume it is the reason they aren't waterproof, their shape is beautiful though the carry case is big and unweildly. I was disappointed that the music offer included with them was not valid in the UK and the replacement offer from Amazon music was beyond pitiful as it wasn't any discount on the  usual subscription price. Overall the headphones are worth it and I won't be returning them. Sony I would appreciate it is you could come up with some kind of waterproofing so I can give them 5 stars!"
Extremely bad engineered. Very cheap build even though they cost 300 plus! Everyone has the same problem with the swivel popped out  ! Another thing is very bad instructions for finding the serial number and model number.
"I bought them purely because my last pair were out dated. But these I recommend to anybody good choice, good headphones very sturdy and Sony are always trustworthy. Perfect for anybody on the go."
Great product!!  Realy recommend. Good job Sony. You keep doing what you best at
I bought the XM5 headphones a few weeks ago after trying them out at a duty free shop at an airport. I tried all the wireless headphone on display and these one stood head and shoulders above anything else. Since buying them I am still delighted with them. Noise cancellation is so good it has to be heard (or not!) to be believed. And the sound quality is fabulous too. I cannot recommend these highly enough.
Came nicely packed with charger cord and instructions in a zipper case. Had no problem connecting to my phone. And the sound is great. No outside noise interference.
"A giant leap forward in wireless noise cancelling, Sony’s WH-1000XM5 Headphones have arrived. From the moment you inbox them until you hear the first sound from them is a simple journey. Download the app and follow the instructions to set the headphones up is very simple and your experience will begin. Individual settings begins with photographing your ears to customise your sounds settings to you, completely adjustable. Each cup had four microphones to capture ambient sounds more accurately, high resolution audio with precise voice pick up technology and wind noise reduction for clearer phone calls. Speak to chat automatically pauses your music and lets in ambient sounds, handy if in a shop! Swift pair makes it easy connecting to devices and battery life of 30 hours makes these new headphones a excellent choice for your listening pleasure!"
"I’ve only just bought the SonyXM5 headphones and the sound quality is amazing, even when you don’t have anything playing it already dulls surrounding sound. So comfy to wear all day."
"From the WH XM4, I can say this was an upgrade in terms of software, quality of life, the sound has better clarity and bass, and the noise cancelling has been further improved, with battery life also being increased from my usage! 

These headphones are comfortable to wear for long periods (8 hour sessions) with the clamp force being one that sticks on your head without causing pressure. The earcups are comfy and don't get too hot, and have a secure fit for noise cancelling.

From the XM4 to the XM5 the only thing I wasn't a completely in love with was the new case as it was larger and doesn't feel as sturdy or protective as the XM4s case, however this change was made as the XM5 earcups don't fold, opting for a noiseless design, which is something I never noticed until switching back and forth with the XM4 while I was putting the two for comparison for a review. The XM5 have no creaking putting them on or taking the off.

These headphones are definitely ones I would recommend to anyone and everyone, and for the XM4 owners, if you have the money, I'd say it's definitely worth upgrading."
"I bought these around 2 weeks ago as of writing. They have been great so far, the simultaneous connection between two devices is rock solid and the Bluetooth connection range / quality is excellent. The ANC is great, and blocks white noise very well. The pass through sound is acceptable, being better than average implementation but not quite as natural as Apple's implementation on their audio products. 
There is a slight issue where they will enter a 'call mode' where the quality of audio drops to facilitate microphone transmission - but it will do this on a computer when playing games even if you're using an external microphone and even have the headphone mic disabled via control panel on Windows; with the only fix being to close whatever app is using any mic.
Overall, great product; even better if you can get it on sale :)"
"I bought these headphones recently and the NC on them are amazing. I love them overall except one thing, the ear cups. There is a strange smell that is coming from them, even though I bought a new pair. Unfortunately I left my city as soon as I bought them and I haven’t been able to return or exchange them at the moment."
"This headphones are superb, miles ahead of competition, after 6 months I try every where, Street, noise factory( Numatic production), plane, and is absolutely almost perfect, the only drawback I found is the talk function, I wish it was better, If I cough or sneeze, it will stop, not just when I am talk, so I had to switch off cos it was quite annoying, when you connect 2 devices sound volume drop, even when only one is working, so I had to switch off function allowed connect 2 devices, and other thing is I cannot connect to my PlayStation 5 via Bluetooth menu on my Ps5, which is ashame, I had to connect to my Samsung Q90R TV"
Purchased my WH-1000XM5 Wireless Headphones recently. Excellent product if a tad expensive!
I’ve had a couple of other headphones at two or three times the price and these are equal if not better!
They are fab. Like really really good. Noise cancellation is good even when it isn’t loud
"I bought these to replace an in ear set of Samsung headphones. The sound quality is amazing and when paired with the app, it makes for an easily customisable listening experience."
"I bought these headphones a month ago and I can't take them off my ears.  The sound quality is fantastic.  However, what surprised me the most was the quality of the ANC.  You can really hear the sound of silence in them."
"I brought these shortly after christmas because there was a sale. The sound on these is soo good! You can truly hear everything within the music! Although, i don’t think i would have brought these for their original price just because i think it’s quite a big price point and you can definitely get good headphones for cheaper. I could recommend working out with these on if your doing anything which requires head movement. They did fall and slip when i was doing an ab workout so just bare that in mind. Overall, for the sound it’s incredible which is why I have given these a 5 star. Also, I have been conflicted whether these are better than the 4s. i’ve seen many many reviews and over all i picked these because of the aesthetic. ANC is also incredible on these! i wear them whilst studying in busy places and genuinely cannot hear anything!"
"had these a few weeks, so can't comment on durability, however they are easily the best headhones I've owned - so why? Sound quality is excellent - I would describe it as smooth.  The detail is phenomanal and there is no ""harshness"" to the music. I found it relaxed me straight away and made me want to listen to more music and revisit old albums. The noise cancelling is truly awesome - even conversation/TV is cut out, but they have some clever tricks up their sleeve, so if you start talking, the musc pauses and ambient sound turns on. The touch control on the right headphone works every time, leaving the phones nicely clear of mutli use buttons and doesn't seem to trigger accidentally. The app is ok once you get the hang of it and set things up how you want. Oh, and they are sooooo comfortable you can almost forget you are wearing them - supersoft ear pads and headband, even with glasses, no pain after an hour of listening - unlike nearly every other pair I've had - especially Sony! I have always loved Sony's committment to quality of sound, I've owned Sony portable equipment since my 1st cassette walkman in the 1980s - which I still have BTW, in full working order :)"
"I’ll be totally honest they are a great set of headphones and they feel very comfortable, the only reason I have given 4* is because I believe the older version were better to fold away and carry, the new version is a backward step in that respect, my only other hate is Amazon and only realised they were connected to the new headphones with Alexa, if I had known that before I sold my old headphones I would never have purchased the WH-1000XM5, that is just a personal reason nothing else, I just hate everything to do with Amazon."
"Love everything about them, especially the style.."
"Comfy, good bass, LDAC support makes a difference for wireless.
I wish you could use the headphones while they are charging though."
"I am really enjoying the great sound quality and noise-canceling capabilities of this product. One feature I think could be improved is the performance of the Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) button. Sometimes, I have to press it multiple times before it turns on/off and it would be useful to have a clear indicator for ANC status (on/off) - either a voice or light."
"Love them ,linked easy to BRAVIA TV and IPad. Good sound, light on the top of my head,BLUE TOOTH great., signal is good in my house, I can walk around the house still connected to Tv. 
I HAVE NOT YET USED other features,like answering call etc ,but think they would be ok.."
"Good sound quality. V comfortable.

Prefer to airbuds. Cleaer instrumentation."
Let me tell you. The packaging was great with the little black case they came in. You cannot hear anything once you have them playing something. They are comfortable easy on ears
These are by far the best noise canceling headphones by Sony! They fit comfortably and you can adjust the bass and treble. Your music will automatically pause if you take them off. Overall awesome sound quality! If you have the money these will not disappoint.
"I bought these a few months ago and I am more than impressed, they have amazing sound cancelling ability and the sound quality is also great. I like the features like when you talk it pauses music and I also like the fact of sliding either up, down, left, right to control music and volume, it's helpful."
"Having used the WH-1000XM4, I upgraded to the WH-1000XM5 but see many of the features do not function properly:
1. While listening to music, the headphones intermittently (and automatically) pause the music. I typically have to resume playback by either pressing the play button on my music app or via the touch sensor control panel on the headphones.

2. Other other times, the headphones just shutdown (turns off) while listening to music. Please note that this and point 1 (above) happen while I'm wearing the headphones and actively listening to music - Not when the headphones are taken off.

I have updated the firmware to the most recent version (1.1.3). I have reset the device to factory setting many times yet the problem persists.
There are many threads on Reddit detailing similar problems yet no fix. So, it's rather disconcerting that Sony hasn't commented on possible fix.

WH-1000XM4 was a great product but seems to have been broken with this latest iteration (WH-1000XM5).

Rating: 
Design: 4/5 - I think the folding feature on the WH-1000XM4 was better
Ease of Use: 3/5 - For the malfunctions described above
Sound Quality: 5/5 - Sound great"
"I bought this product less than 6 months ago.  I took it off to put on my nightstand, then when I picked it up, the right headphone where it connect to the slider cracked and is dangling.  Now the right headphone doesn't even press against my ear.  Also a wire is exposed.  I contacted Sony customer support, and then told me that was 'physical damage' and not covered by warranty."
"My first set of over-ear headphones for many years. 
First impression: A smart carry case, with a fabric finish that I really like, perhaps a little large so it goes in a backpack. I found that the case could take a small battery pack to the headphones can recharge. 
The noise cancelling is fabulous. You can listen to music in the same room as someone watching TV and have no interruption.
On to a not so good. There are lots of booklets full of data, but no instruction manual. In theory you need to download a Sony app to be able to change the sound style, it takes a while. I found that when using the app if the phone is in my back pocket, it can randomly turn off or change the settings. In a jacket pocket this doesn’t happen. 
There’s an option to sign up for 360 degree sound, but it doesn’t work with any well know music app that I have on my phone.
So what is my conclusion. Primarily I use the headphones without the app, the sound is sumptuous, even on trains and planes, Fantastic for travel, for more active use I use Sony in ear.
Ease of set up 60%
Sound quality 100%"
They look great and feel good wearing them. After I learn more about them I will have more to add
I’m so happy I chose WH-100XM5 pair of cans instead of the iPod max. I think these headphones are far better in sound and lighter in weight so you can wear them all day.
"Overall a great experience, sound quality is great and the noise cancelling is perfect, they are light and comfortable to wear for long hours. Only reason i have four stars is that worry that the hinges may break due to the smaller and fragile build."
"Received as a gift.  I am very pleased with the headphones, love the colour Very stylish."
"Really pleased with these headphones. Although I am no audiophile, I think the sound quality is superb. The noise cancellation is also excellent. Really comfortable to wear for long periods. Did a lot of research before buying these and I am really impressed."
I currently own the Bose QC Ultra and recently purchased the 1000XM5. The sound is exceptional on both but where Sony beats Bose is on phone calls. The microphone on the Sony's 1000XM5 is far superior than the microphone on the Bose QC Ultra.
Very disappointing. Uncomfortable and certainly no better than my iPods. Returned after two days.
Sony's WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones are amazing. The sound is crisp and clear. I love these headphones !!
"My Grand Daughter is autistic and can't stand certain noises and these wireless noise cancelling headphones help her to be able to read and also focus on the work she needs to do at school, especially when she is doing tests. These are great quality and work  great!"
"XM2, XM3, XM4 and now XM5. Still the Best sounding wireless NC headphones!"
Wow! These are awesome.  They feel very high tech.  The sound is great. It connects easily through Bluetooth to my phone. The headphones are comfortable and hold a good charge.
"Very comfortable headphones, giving excellent sound quality. Although they are obviously intended to be used via Bluetooth I prefer to attach them to my Arcam Solo with the cable provided, and they do not disappoint.  The sound is impressively clear with just the right balance between higher register notes and solid bass."
"I invested between $300 and $400 in these headphones, expecting a blend of top-notch quality and lasting durability for the price. Regrettably, the experience fell short of my expectations. 

Merely a few days post-purchase, while engaged in my work session with a cup of hot tea nearby, the headphones abruptly malfunctioned. The cause seemed to be the humidity from the tea. In an instant, the sensors (excluding the touchpad) ceased functioning, resulting in the loss of auto-pause and other features. Additionally, the audio quality deteriorated, becoming hissy, and the noise cancellation feature completely failed. 

This purchase turned out to be a disappointing waste of money, and I deeply regret buying this product."
"Buying any wireless headphones always comes with compromises. I bought these based on a number of reviews praising the ANC of these headphones and they do not disappoint. Sound quality is better than previous versions but not as good as the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 - however those headphones do not match the ANC of the Sony and are significantly heavier. The Sony headphones are also richer in terms of features and while I would prefer more buttons as opposed to touch controls, they are streets ahead in terms of modern features such as adaptive sound control, wear sensors, and usage logging. If you commute regularly, these are an essential buy."
"I got these wireless earphones and they are awesome
I like how the ear muffs swivel and I like how well they fit. Perfect fit. The sound quality is great and the noise cancellation is great as well. Will definitely be recommending to everyone to go out and buy"
"These head phones are incredible but first the packaging is sooo aesthetically amazing so well thought out and visually pleasing and the case is pristine . The noise canceling is phenomenal as 
well. The sound quality is out of this world and I love how when you take them off the music pauses till you put them back on these are definitely a must have"
I bought 2days ago. I am planning to use this for my free time.
"Great ANC, okay sound quality. the black is nice but shows oil and finger prints very easily."
Happy with product in terms of sound but design could have more comfortable around headband
"Blown away by the sound quality on these headphones deep bass is a big one for me and the have it. Also my first NC headphones and I can't stop playing around with it, it cuts out everything!"
"I only ever wore these indoors whilst listening to music or watching films an after 1 week I would occasionally hear a high pitched scream in the right earcup, after 2 months the headset was fully dead after returning it to Sony I was told it was water damage and outside of warranty, a fix would cost £155. The only way the headset could have had water enter is from sweat meaning it was standard wear and tear from daily use. I have had QC35 2’s for 3 years and even been caught out in the rain while wearing them and they still work fine, so if you are after a durable product or something that will last longer than it’s own battery look elsewhere."
"This is my first Sony headphone and it's absolutely amazing. Great sound, perfect call quality"
"I bought my first pair a month or so ago and the noise canceling wasn't good at all, noise kept being filtered in. I couldn't even notice any difference from the noise canceling setting and the ambient setting. They both sounded exactly the same with the outside world being loud. Got them replaced with a newer pair through customer service but they both have the same issue, I'm guessing all of them are like this at this point. They are really comfortable tho at least."
"These headphones were great, right until they suddenly stopped working. One day it was fine, and the next day when I turned it on, there was no sound on the right side. Factory resetting and connecting to different devices didn't help, nor did charging the headphones again or using it in wired mode. This is very disappointing for such an expensive product."
"Love them. Loud and comfortable. Also let’s you hear the background if you want to. 

My daughter needs earphones for school and this one are awesome.

Came in a so pretty bag,  Love these headphones. Great quality. Soft & comfortable on the ears."
"Not necessarily the best fit on the head... But, easy to use, really good all around sound and performance. Quality indoor and outdoor sound. A Thumbs up."
"Overall I like the headphones , but I think the firmware was bugs, example if you turn on auto turn off (so when you take the headphones off they auto turn off so the battery dose not go flat) I find they also auto turn off while wearing them every 15mins or so, and the forms just say yes thats an issue turn off auto turn off and they work! So a known bug for some time and not fixed."
"Not only does the noice cancellation work incredibly well, but the audio fidelity is unmatched. I can’t recommend these headphones enough to those looking for new one. They’re incredibly comfortable and you’d forget you’re wearing them if it wasn’t for the audio coming through them."
I’ve almost given up! I’m very disappointed with the the utter lack of basic functionality: Microsoft Teams and this headset are not inspiring confidence.
These headphones are amazing in every way. Amazing low end mids and crystal clear highs. I would highly recommend to anyone. There by far the best headphones I have ever used. Great quality
Very easy to connect and accessible noise cancelling button is handy. Headphones are very comfortable and much better than my Aitpods for longer term use. Sound and build quality is very good. Like the handy travel bag that houses then so protected on the go
"I am a fan of Sony headphones and I've possessed the previous versions as well. I started with the XM3 and was impressed by the sound (which is the most important feature in a headphone for me). With the XM3 I also discovered the ANC for the first time. The XM4 was an upgrade of the ANC but I found that the sound quality didn't change, though it kept an high standard. With the XM5 both sound and ANC quality increased together with the price, which is the reason for the 4 stars."
"Great noise canceling
Great noise canceling
Great noise canceling"
I bought this brand new yesterday from the Inmotion shop (WH Smith) in the Departure area at Gatwick North Terminal and the headset is impossible to charge.Tried everything. Wasted several hours - frustrating.
"These are easily the best headphones I have ever owned. In terms of sound, features (changing the track, volume, calls on the headphones themselves!!!), they somehow upgraded on the XM4. Yes, they cost more but without a shadow of a doubt you get way more for your money."
"I really appreciate the sound quality on these! Unfortunately, the headband starts hurting the top of my head after just one 30-minute meeting. I'm hoping the wider band on the XM4s will be less painful. Also, the ear covers hang too low on my head so they're more on my jaw and neck than my ears."
one of the best headphone ever i had in my life i would like to recommend everyone to buy this
a vast improvement on my old phones great battery life and comfort
"I bought this a few weeks ago as it was on sale for £279. I am overall pleased with the purchase as the sound quality is amazing with deep base. The Sony app is great to use for example being able to seamlessly switch between devices connected via Bluetooth. One negative is comfort, compared to the Bose quiet comfort this isn’t as comfortable granted that the Bose is far more expensive. I have large ears and I wish the ear muffs we’re deeper and slightly larger to fully cover my ears."
So many pros and no cons. These WH-1000XM5 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Canceling Headphones are great. So easy to use and par. The sound quality is top notch and the noise cancelling is amazing. So lightweight and very comfortable too. These headphones are the best ones we've found.
"Best wireless headphones, I have ever owned.
I would recommend."
These are the best headphones available on the market today. I had Apple max headphones previously but they broke out of warranty and i bought these. These are much better noise cancelling tech.
"I now have 3 of these, 1 each of the 3 different colours so far produced. I also like the similar model from Bose, but find the Sony ear cushions more durable. Great for streaming music through my iPad and for watching/listening to the TV."
Ok so I really like the headphones but I would only buy again if the noise cancelling level could be set by the user not by AI. This is a deal breaker for me and would purchase the xm4 instead. Take note Sony!
"Worth the money . Not my words
I had given my friends to try the sound quality and everyone said the same thing anc and the sound quality are just out of the world."
Recently received this product a few days ago and I down right need this masterpiece these headphones are perfect sound quality all around output of this is amazing it wrks it definitely a great asset because I wrk out a lot as well bt these are perfect definitely recommend this product to family and friends
"Bought some headphones, made sure I wasn't subscribed to any mailing lists and yet they completely ignore that and spam you."
"I bought these a month ago in an airport and after 3 weeks I could not charge them. I went through Sony Australia for support, but was told that I had to go back to the store in the overseas airport for support, or pay for them to be repaired. I felt that this was very disappointing, not only to have a product that was broken in 3 weeks, but also that such a large organisation couldn't provide support for a product purchased in an international airport. Possibly I was unlucky with these headphones; however, while they appeared to be decent quality, they didn't last long enough for me to form a strong impression over my previous Bose headphones."
"Had over a month now and better than my Bose QE that they replaced (which were stolen).   For the price, I can’t fault and genuinely could not see how headphones double the price could be any better."
"I'm probably not a typical owner in that I’ve become hard of hearing and struggle to hear TV dialogue, especially with so many actors adopting ""grating, gravelly"" voices at the bottom of their registers. I also have a lifelong interest in hifi and good quality sound so I wanted headphones that would help me listen to TV and Radio, be east to connect and disconnect via Bluetooth and have decent musical quality. 

So, they certainly help the TV and Radio dialogue problem. Wonderful as he is, Hugh Laurie’s accent for House as the series progress is still a challenge but, generally, I can now follow most screenplays very well. Bluetooth connectivity is excellent, especially the support for two concurrent devices and the ease of disconnecting one device to connect a third. Music playback is very good, too. You’d need to pay many times more to get true high fidelity but, at this price point they’re better than I expected and very good for easy listening. 

Downsides?  There are two, for me. Cupping the right ear interrupts play to allow conversation but so does any inadvertent gesture or touch of that side. I find it a pain and would rather manually switch off when interruptied. Secondly, I find the headband uncomfortable. I wish it was a true flat band rather than the rolled thing it is. In that sense, I wish I'd bought the WH-1000XM4 but I did want the latest sound processor, wind deflection and Bluetooth….

Overall, they’re excellent and a very safe purchase - if any of the qualities worry you, buy from an outlet where you can try them against competition."
"Good build quality, battery is fine (haven't had to recharge yet). Sound is good.
However, I run a discord game and like to listen to music from youtube at the same time. These headphones mute the music when voice channel comes on. Tried holding two fingers to the control panel, no change. Had to go wired. Mobile app only, so can't control from PC? Maybe a niche case, but something that matters to me."
Happy happy happy I like it a lot. Best sound ever and the noice chanselig is the best
"Difficult to use on laptop and phone, bluetooth works best on one or the other"
"These Sony Noise Canceling headphones are excellent! So many great features with these headphones and has a great collapsible carrying case and the charge last up to 30 hours. These wireless headphones are comfortable and have touch controls so you can pause, play or control the volume."
These headphones work just as they should.  They are clearly noise canceling as you can't hear anything from the outside of them.  The sound is phenomenal.  They are comfortable as well.
"These headphones are really brilliant. The sound is excellent and the noise canceling is the best I have heard. My only complaint would be the extra features, as an 80 year old man I am unable to find my way around apps. etc. Therefore I do not use these features which may be useful if they were more simple. Perhaps some could be made accessible on the headphones themselves."
"My lovely girlfriend bought these for me as a birthday present.  I use them mostly for on-line chats and videoconferences, but also for watching computer video.  Really good quality sound and excellent battery life too!"
Sony - WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones great head set. I live listening to music and they last long.
"I have tested the headphones for the last 30 days through a variety of music and frequencies. They're nothing short of exceptional. The comfort and style are also excellent, you can wear them for long periods without any discomfort. The noise cancelling is perhaps slightly less than expected but that is perhaps due to my expectations being unrealistic. They cancel out all ambient, background fuzz but you can still hear people talking, although not loud enough to be able to make out what is being said. I would rate the NC at 8/10.. the features on the headphones themself are great, a press and hold on the right pad allows you to instantly pause the noise cancelling function which continues again immediately upon release. Overall I can't rate them any less than a 9/10."
Bought around 10 days ago. Extremely pleased with all aspects
"I received it after more than 1 month of ordering.
But it's not fun. I feel my product has been used. Charging cords and connection wires are not neatly arranged.
The headset also has something yellow.
I am very disappointed in this."
Got this a few weeks back. The productivity in terms of noise cancellation has been great as well as the base effect for music. I have found it perfect for work meetings and music .
Really good quality. Silence and long working time.
Bought these in November the poor build quality ment that the inexpensive plastic used degraded after less than 7 months of very light use having only being removed from the supplied case on a handful of occasions during long trips. What followed has singularly been the worst customer service experience I have everhad as for the sound quality it's good but cheaper more robust headphones I own can compete and another brand well known for noise cancelling outperforms the noise cancelling abilities of the sonys. However the main reason to avoid these is in case you have the misfortune to have to contact Sonys customer service!
I bought these together like a month ago and was one of the best decision I've made
"What a game changer!! I previously had Sony earphones which whilst providing great quality sound i found kept falling out of my ears, particularly when working out or exercising. I looked at reviews to see what were the best over ear options on the market which on most occasions flagged the WH-1000XM5. Needless to say the majority of people can't be wrong, so i went with my gut and grabbed a set.
WOW! Safe to say i have not owned a pair like this, great noise cancellation, superb audio quality and comfort, and ease of use is second to none!
I am thoroughly glad i purchased these headphones and would not hesitate to recommend to others! If you are looking for the best wireless headphone experience you can get for a decent price, you need look no further!!"
I bought these headphones for uni and it’s the best decision I made. Great sound and noise cancellation on them. Would definitely recommend
Requested by my son for his birthday. He is really happy with them. Sound is amazing.
Wonderfull sound! Very happy! Also so confortable.
I’ve had these about 2 weeks now and love them so far. It’s brilliant to create different settings for different locations and the noise cancelling is the best I’ve experienced. Would definitely recommend.
Been using them since I get them and they are easy to use
"Honestly, bought them today, after months of pondering, reading reviews and watching videos. Glad I made the purchase, excellent noise cancelling and wonderful sound. Perfect fit around my ears aswell. It's like they were made specifically for me."
Feels flimsy at the turning points. Sound all muffled and inferior till you adjust eq to your taste. ANC also needs work mic during calls when in bus also needs more calls but close to perfect in other scenarios. Headphones need to love a little drizzle a bit more. Touch disabling needs to be an option for when in the rain. I still recommend after setting eq.
I bought a few months ago but have only really just stared to use them.A huge leap musically from AirPods 2 and Bose 35.They are so comfortable and there are so many features that I need to explore further
Overall the sound quality is better than the beats studios and Apple AirPods pro that I had however the sound cancellation isn’t even comparable. With the buds I couldn’t hear anything at all where as with the Sonys I can hear my pug breathing. Not sure if it’s my specific pair that might be faulty but I expected slightly better.  There also seems to be some crackly sound coming from the left speaker almost like a record player.
I bought these and by far the most amazing headphones I've ever had but the construction is bad they broke after just 2 months of owning it
"Gorgeous design, excellent sound - really lovely item"
"I have been using the Sony WH-1000XM5 now for almost 2 weeks and all I can say is simply amazing 
I come from a background of enjoying soundbars, a decent set of headphones will blow any sound bar out of the water.
Typical Sony build quality, I like the simplistic design and comfort and controls are easy to use, the app makes everything easy to set up.
I can't honesty think of anything negative to say, if I was being nit picky, the outer plastics are a bit of a finger print magnet (skin grease).
My hats off to you Sony, a fantastic product, superb sound quality and a simple yet fantastic comfortable design.

Highly recommend."
"After owning 2 pairs of xm3s I decided to upgrade, and these xm5s have lots of problems that I never experienced with either pair of xm3s over many years of use. In just a few weeks of owning them, and despite them being on the latest firmware,  I have had them not turn off automatically after disconnecting from Bluetooth device, randomly turn on the speak to chat function despite being set to off in the app and not even touching the headphones at all, and incidents of the sound of a press on the touch pad going haywire like it's being pressed 5 times a second. Also had times where the touch pad does absolutely nothing at all, only solved after googling, and the solution was to turn off the automatic turn off when not detected being worn function. Terrible that i will have to turn off features in order for them to function properly. Pretty unimpressed with this, had I not sold my xm3s I would return these in a heartbeat."
"These are by far the best headphone I have bought.

I did think they are perfect... however, you can't listen and charge them at the same time.  But with extremely fast charging: 3 hours' worth of charge after just 3 minutes using the correct type of adapter."
Pre-ordered with Sony Xperia !V. Great Speakers with Quality Sound and even on wireless
"What a great set of high quality, noise cancelling headphones from Sony!

For comfort, they are light and highly adjustable, with soft ear cups and headband, ensuring they stay in place as well as not becoming irritable after a period of time. This is just as well as the battery life is exceptional, with 30 hours on a full charge and 3 hours in just 3 mins. 

There is a handy red dot above the right cup, inside the headband to quickly remind you which way round to put them on! When first worn, even powered off, you have a sense of complete cover over the ear and how immediately the ambient sound is reduced. Then when turned on and the noise cancelling is activated, almost no ambient sounds can be heard. Then play some music and forget about around you!

The Headphones Connect app from Sony is essential: it enables scenario specific noise cancelling through the Adaptive Sound Control, according to the activity and location, and even learns your preferences. You are even able to control the amount of ambient noise allowed in. All of this is cleverly managed by microphones inside and outside the ear cup. A true test of the noise cancelling was while mowing the lawn: very impressive.

There are a multitude of settings and functions available within the app, too many to go through here, but one that I have found extremely useful is being able to connect to two devices at once. Using the Headphones Connect app while connected to my TV or laptop allows control of the functions while listening to another source. 

Beyond the app, there is an intuitive touch control pad on the flat side of the right cup. Volume, track choice and call receiving all wok using taps and swipes. The clarity that the microphones provide in call is envied by those that I´m talking to: they find it difficult to believe I´m using headphones.

Be patient for a software update, when it occurs, but nice to see regular support through the app.

Still trying to get to grasp with all of the functions, like Speak-to-chat and the seriously useful Pause when headphones taken off, especially when watching a film and an inevitable interruption; I am thoroughly enjoying this impressive high quality product from Sony."
"Very good sound out of  the box and comfortable. Only gripes are a lack of start up instructions in the box, I hate having to download apps just to learn how to use the thing. Also the charging lead is far too short."
"i bought this just a month ago and it was an amazing product, sound quality is nice, design is sleek and modern, I just don't like how the headphones are not in the correct orientation when I want to rest it on my neck (ear muffs not laying flat on the shoulder/chest area) when I decide to stop listening for a while."
"I bought this amazing headphones for me like 7 days ago, I’m still surprised by the quality of the sound"
I bought these as replacements for my XM3 model which broke at the hinge . I was very happy with them and the xm5 are as good if not better. The slight disappointment I have is they have done away with the voice prompt and replaced it with a tone and it is not always clear what has been selected or if they have powered off or you are on ambiant sound on or off.
I bought these headphones being recommended by Sevenoaks audio as 'being the best around' I am thoroughly enjoying the crispness and clarity with all the different music and sound I listen to.
"Received these about 2 weeks ago and everything about them is a massive step up from my WH-1000XM3. Minor point, they don't fold like WH-1000XM3"
I pre ordered these headphones looking for an upgrade however I am beyond dissatisfied being given a faulty pair of headphones that no longer work. Will not be ordering future headphones.
"I received these with my Sony Xperia 1 M5, I was sceptical about using them as last year I had a major reaction to them on my ears due to the synthetic material used for the ear pads, that was one year ago, no joy from John Lewis customer services who basically said my condition wasn't covered under there 2 year guarantee they advised to contact Sony and even had the cheek to suggest I trade them in.
I contacted Sony who contacted me the next day and took my details and concerns and said they'd contact me the next day.....that was last summer.so I decided to try the headphones again I only wore them for maximum of 6 hours, as last year I did put it down to the heat but the next day as last year my ears flared up, blistered and clear liquid seeping from the blisters, I cleared the headphones and traded them in, regardless of becoming intolerant to pleather I feel, John Lewis could have dealt with me better and Sony customer service could have bothered to contact me regarding my concerns."
"Ive had these for over 2 weeks and they're excellent, the quality in sound and build is top notch. The noise cancelling is almost comparable to in-ear which cements why these are industry leading in noise cancelling. Great bass and hi-res audio is clear even with heavy bass. Definitely recommend them if you can spare the money to buy."
After having the XM's4 I had to upgrade too the xm5 and believe me they are worth the upgrade...
"These Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones are perfect! The box even seems super nice that they come in. They are super sleek in modern looking. They fit on your head really nicely and don’t dig or fall off. The quality of the sound is out of the The box even seems super nice that they come in. They are super sleek in modern looking. They fit on your head really nicely and don’t dig or fall off. The quality of the sound surpasses anything I’ve ever experienced. Most importantly they actually are actually noise canceling. They are perfect to take on flights, jogging, and so much more. I just absolutely love mine!"
"These head phones have got to be the best you can buy or really close to it, is it the absolutle way these head phones connect seemlessly to any of my products like my Sony phone turn on connects instantly or my blue tooth sender I use to connect to the tv so as not to disturb the wife in bed when she is working a over night turn it on and pow it connects so easy whether is a phone ,TV sterio blue tooth sender then theres Alexa connected like in moments using the hand gestures and my voice as these head sets have a built in microphone connecting to 360 deezer was a sinch after seting up the account, is it the sound in my book the sound qualtiy is top noch with the spatial sound and the 360 sound you are so going to love these head phones and I have only charged them once in thirty hour of use not continuos I will admit. is it the comfort of some well padded and so soft ear pads admittingly I had to take my own hearing aids off when wearing these head set way to loud with them on but there is ample volume for me and comfort I have wore them for seven hours staight with no swearing issue, We are in our French at the momment and as back in the uk connection is so easy. I do have another Sony head set SBH60 these head phones whack them out of the ball park and into space try thses once you will not want to use any other head set ever again, O did I mention they com with a charging cable and a perfect carry case all delivered in a cardboard package that is recyclable.  
Well any down side to these Headphone I haven't found any yet apart from amazon not letting me have the three month free 360 music trial as i have use them before on a free trial thats not Sony fault."
Sony have achieved a masterpiece in design. I don’t know how they could improve on these headphones.
My first experience using noise cancelling headphones. Made travelling through the airport a completely different experience!
"The product arrived in what appears to be planet friendly packaging, certainly no plastic on the outside or packaging.

The Reference Guide included requires an electron microscope to read. The Help Guide is an essential download for Seniors like me.

I was up and running within seconds listening to music from my tablet. From new, all you need to know is hold down the power button for 2 seconds. Once connected it takes you to the Sony Headphones Connect App in the Store.

Registering the product on the Sony Website has its usual challenges. There is nothing on the box or headphones that says serial number or s/n. Also, no numbers on the box or headphones are the same. I opted for a number on the headphones which was very difficult to read under the pads. I have no idea if this is the right number!

The charging light is bright, clear, and reassuring. My only gripe is I wish it had been supplied with a USB-C to USB-C charging cable, but I suppose most people still use the old USB-A chargers, I don’t. The light goes out when fully charged.

The noise cancelling is excellent, as we expect from a Sony product. It must be said that simply wearing the headphones switched off attenuates the high frequencies, leaving just the low frequencies at a reduced volume. I found it very weird not hearing the usual click, bang and everyday noises while doing the day-to-day chores and housework.

The sound quality to my old ears is excellent on the full frequency range. Again, they fully meet my expectations from a quality Sony product.

I really like the Speak-to-Chat function. You are happily listening to music, and you notice somebody wants your attention. Simply start speaking and the music mutes and you hear the person talking to you.

The touchpad is very intuitive, like swipe down to reduce the volume. Forward to skip to the next track etc. The buttons are easy to find, and once you learn their functions operate perfectly. The voice guidance is good too.

The Alexa integration works with the Alexa App open on your device. It does work but falls into a category I call gimmicks. However very useful for Amazon Music but I found it difficult to get back to music on my device. But that is probably just my age.

Connection to various devices is quick and easy. I tried it on my phone, tablet, television, laptop, and Desktop PC. 

Having used the headphones for an extended period I find they are very comfortable and lightweight. If it wasn’t for the sound, I wouldn’t know I was wearing them.

After continuous use for approximately 4 hours after a full charge (very quick), the battery indicator is still showing 95% charged.

If you are looking for premium over the ear noise cancelling headphones, you cannot go wrong with these.

Highly recommended."
"I purchased these headphones 1 month ago all I can say is there just awesome , I happen to own many  different  pairs and these buy far are the best ones I would recommend great sound the noise canceling is outstanding what I really like is the Sony App it really has some great features , don’t pass this up you won’t regret it !"
"It is my third pair , i had the wh1000xm2 , wh1000xm4 and wh1000xm5.
I compare the quality to ...all competition, there is no doubt the 4 model and 5 model 
are simply the best !"
Again Sony has excelled in producing a pair of headphones that leaves the competitors behind. I like the new design. They are comfortable to wear and the noise cancelling is really put to the test in noisy flight cabins and trains but all I can say is wow.
"I just bought these about a week ago and they a very, very good! The sound quality is fantastic and the reality audio 360 too. I had been getting more noisy from my new neighbours recently which I had never had before and after reading lots of reviews about the xm5 s was swithering about getting them 
but decided to take the plunge and buy them. The noise cancelling is outstanding!!! I also work long hours in a fast paced, busy, noisy restaurant environment and sometimes at the end of my shift just want to cut off the outside world. These are perfect for that and a joy to wear!"
"These are by far the best headphones I've ever had the pleasure of using. Clear, crisp and loud sound and the noise cancelling is incredible. They're so comfortable I forget that I'm wearing them sometimes"
"My wife bought me these whilst I was in hospital, great sound and noise reduction meant I could listen to music without all the noice going on around me"
"Absolutely love these headphones, they’re so light and comfortable to wear even for long periods of time, the sound is superb and the noise cancelling works well. Bluetooth connectivity is good and the headphones app really helps"
"Bought these a few weeks ago and have been wanting a set for a while, but the price has held me back.
The sound quality can't be faulted and I'm hearing things I couldn't before, so that's great!
Range of sound is amazing, with enough bass, but not to much.
Noise cancelling is very good, but not really tested in a very noisy environment yet.
The overall quality is OK, not as premium as I hoped for the money, but this seems to be the case with most electronics. 
Zip on case feels like it may fail at anytime, and for a premium set up this is disappointing, and the case itself doesn't feel that high end either.
Having said this, I would recommend them to anyone as the main thing is sound quality and it's 5* for this..."
"Purchased last month and the sound is amazing, hearing parts of songs I’ve not heard before. Love them."
"I would never have this item again were it not for my partner buying me a new pair as a surprise to replace my previous pair. I really enjoyed using my XM5s and I rate them well but I never wanted to deal with Sony again. Reason, I purchased a pair of XM5s last year and my warranty was still within the year.  I contacted Sony as the Bluetooth was no longer connecting to any devices I tried. To be fair, the customer service rep was courteous and patient, but my issue could not be resolved as I no longer had the serial number. Please be warned, this is how Sony catches you out with this product. The serial number is on the packaging which the average person disposes of. It is no where on the XM5, it is not imprinted so you have a permanent record of it on the product in case you lose or dispose of your packaging.  Though I had proof of purchase, without this serial number, Sony would not take my headphones in for repairs. I realise that there is no serial number in the product itself because with this new replacement, I see where the serial number is and it is on a sticker, on a strip of packaging which detaches from the box (a banner around the box). It is not even printed within the box or headphone case. 
They are not cheap headphones and I am out of pocket. Whilst I liked the headphones, I planned to go to a competitor for my next purchase who offer good products.
Totally disgusted in Sony and I truly warn you to beware of this stealth-like way they avoid supporting or respecting you as a valuable customer. Whilst  I would recommend the product, sadly I cannot recommend Sony until they resolve this."
"I purchased it before while coming back from my Europe tour. I was really awestruck by it's noise cancelling and weight. I was using it straight from the take off to the landing upto 12-13 Hours flight from LHR to GCM still I didn't feel any uncomfortable. Before I have used Beats, Bose, Soundcore and now I can easily say I did the right choice. Really loving it."
"Just bought them, but very satisfied with what Ive tested so far."
"These headphones are absolutely brilliant, being so light they are very comfortable to use. The performance is absolutely superb with no intrusion from outside. Storage box offers good protection when not in use. 
An excellent product at a competitive price."
"Very comfortable, with incredible noise cancellation"
I tried a few and this did seem the best sound so hope it works out. Why are there no printed set up instructions with it? Pages of regulatory pish and nothing about the controls or charging.  And why is the USB lead so short? 9inches! Hopeless.
Since a while i was looking a mobile headphones that maintain the sound quality I'm used to with living room headphones. I bought these and i think i reached there
"First day of use. Used them occasionally In the past (demos in shops). Always wanted to purchase, now made it and I’m really happy!"
I couldn’t be happier with the build and sound quality of these headphones. I had reservations about spending that much on headphones but my post purchase regrets went away upon first use. Sony just earned another loyal customer.
"Ok, these are the first 'over the head' high quality wireless headphones I have used and I have to say they have set the bar really high. I have some top end wired Sony Hi Res headphones with no noise cancelling along with some competitors wired noise cancelling headphones and these beauties are on par if not better than both. 
Firstly the aesthetics are very good, you receive them in a Sony blended material box that might be completely recycled but has a nice solid feel to it and looks nice. 
Then, when you open up inside is the carry case which may be a bit thicker than I'd like but I'm happy to live with it as it keeps the contents safe. The first view of the WH-1000XM5 is impressive, nice matt finish with classy leather essentials that are very very comfortable indeed and I didn't find my ears getting too hot after 4 hours of continual wear. I'm not sure about all day comfortable but I don't think I could wear any headphones all day.
The side panel with all the little tweaks and tricks is a joy to use after looking at the accompanying guide and very quickly becomes intuitive. This is very cleverly done and it seems they were developed with someone who has a similar brain to me because they just work.
The sound is really really good with full range and depth, I don't know if I'm imagining it but feel it's not quite as expansive as when they are plugged in via the included cable, that being said Marvin Gaye singing Mercy Mercy Me in Hi Res on my Xperia 5ii is absolutely sublime with all the layers coming through nicely and Marvins smooth voice an utter joy. 
The noise cancelling is really effective and again the handy side panel enabling you to just hold it to hear is so handy. It makes you feel like it is just you and the music which is exactly what I want. 
I have used the 360 audio before with other Sony headphones and I have to say these seem to get a bit more out of the separation truly surrounding you with glorious sound.
I subjected them to War Of The Worlds Multi Channel and it was absolutely stunning, I was completely lost for the duration, hanging on to Richard Burtons every word and emerged into the story completely.
The bluetooth range is outrageously good compared to anything else I have, with the phone in the house I can reach the end of my garden (30m+) with ease and that's on 'Sound quality preferred' setting!
All in all I'm struggling to find fault with these at all, maybe the price but realistically is there anything better out there? I'm not sure there is."
"Had the MX2 version which I use mainly for in-flight, so when I saw the MX5 announced I made the decision to purchase.  Good choice.  
Very comfortable to wear. The new soft leather feel ear covering is excellent, you don't get that uncomfortable, sweaty feel, a major plus when your doing trans-Atlantic flights.  Also very comfortable to sleep in on the over night flights.  The headband is not like a vice grip, in fact it is so light touch I did realize I had them on! Sound, exceptional, be it on Bluetooth with the phone or tablet or wired into the aircraft. Retained the easy to use controls for sound, channel change as well as switching to ambient, even better is the ambient sound control with your voice which again is super while on flights and cabin crew speak to you. App is very easy, especially as the air pressure sensitivity is built in, a plus after takeoff. Just know I'm going to have to invest in a pair for my partner"
Great fit and sound. So comfortable to wear. Bought at a great price when on offer. What’s not to like!
"I got them for myself but not had chance to use them yet. Bombarded with emails to review so here you go. 

I expect they are ok but not used them yet! 
Not fully worked the operations out yet as not used them! 
I like the colour!"
amazing headphones! they fit so well and are very comfortable for long periods of time. Battery life is good as well. I was hesitant to buy these at first because of the price but I can honestly say it is definitely worth it
Great sound quality. Ease of setup with Apple needs a little technical know-how. They are very large- slightly too big for my small (female) head and do not grip tightly.
I am really pleased with these headphones. I work in a noisy environment and they really help block out the buzz of activity and instead fill my ears with some high quality soothing tones to keep me sane. Recommended to all who want less noise from their surroundings but don't want to comprimise their audio quality.
"My initial impression was unimpressed, but having now set up correctly I am now impressed. My priority was high res music sound quality and this has been achieved. I wanted a strong bass. Got it. Would be better if buttons were coloured. Noise cancelling probably good, but not a priority for me as main use is at home."
"Bought this in 2022 November and have daily driven it until now ( 24/02/2024). I will talk about the pros/cons and the nasty side of these headphones. Now i upgraded from beats solo 3, which btw cannot be compared with this, however they were extremely reliable and got the job done no significant features expect for being wireless(standard now lol). Now less talk about those and more on the xm5 ill start with the good side of them.

I don't remeber anything going wrong with the shipping, so i assume that went smoothly. But the main things that stand out: noise cancelation, ambient mode, thin headband and not being foldable. noise cancelation is great don't expect the higher pitch noises to be cancelled aka voices but like background noise like on planes these are magical haven't had any problem with that. As for ambient mode also fantastic WHEN IT WORKS (will mention later) almost as if i had them off but a little bit muffled if you actually try to compare them on and off, else you wont notice. Everyone thinks these things are one with me or something and as someone to had worn these for the majority of day time I can say that you wont notice the headband unless you actually try to but over all comfort wise 10/10. As for being not foldable coming from beats solo 3 which were i just adapted  the only loss was not being able to tuck them in my jacket pocket(big) and honestly that's a W for me cause my old headphones broke after I yanked it out of the jacket pocket and broke the headband so hey at least that ain't happening again XD. battery life great if you have them on 12 hours straight with music, 25% volume expect to use 50%  so basically 2 days no prob and if you use them less than 12 hours then a whole week parps. Also the ear cups are removable just need a butter knife for prying and yea it can survive multiple falls ( from chest height), i know this from experience :/ . Also audio quality? its blooming £300, what you expect it to be mid???

Now onto the cons bad stuff. I am either extremely unlucky or this is normal but i have a list of these. Starting with my very first issue random touch censor beeping noises(also known as ghost touch or phantom touch), these are extremely irritating and have no solution(as far as i know) , this pretty much deems the touch censors as useless and have to be switched off in the settings as they will randomly stop/ change volume or skip songs, i believe it has to do with moisture building up in the right ear cup. speaking of moisture for some reason once removing the ear cups moisture only built up in the right ear cup (touch censor side) however once clearing the ghost touch issue still remains :( however a quick on and off usually deals with it. Now onto next issue I ran into was the ambient mode stuff, avoid moist places (shower room or any wet gassy area) cause i swear these headphones are allergic to that, ooh wait i forgot they are not water resistant... but still no moist air ambient mode in the right ear will have fuzzy sounds and sometimes it might randomly just sound clearer as if your ear unblocked when on a flight. And finally the smell, when i first got these they were fantastic great smell in the earcups(probably harmful to inhaul) anyways left ear seems to always be fine but where as right ear one day it just started to smell bad, gave it a clean (inside foam/ earcup) still didn't solve it, turns out it was the great solid foam thing in the headphone (i did not take it apart)all i did was take a cotton bud and lightly tap the grey thing and ooh god that thing 100% absorbs anything that touches it because it was horrific. however after a few more taps with the cotton bud the smell left???? idk how that works but if it works it works. 

AND FINALLY the conclusion. in conclusion if you live in a dry place(air wise) and want a headphone with great noise cancelling these are the one, However you live in a more moist place issues you will face: touch censor spamming the touch noises randomly, fuzzy ambient mode in the right earcup, and bad smell (just be clean should solve that) overall great headphones but would i recommend these to family/ friends/ others? probably not the touch censor randomly picking up stuff is a BIG issue extremely irritating and no one seemed to talk about it when i bought these but if your fine with that then nothing else too bad tbh, this is not a comparison review more of a review on the cons/issues (in my opinion this is extremely important when buying something you plan to use on the long run), as for spelling mistakes/ grammar i just wanted to type on my new keyboard just went ahead and typed stuff that i experienced with these. BUT if i was to go back in time with my current knowledge on these id still get the xm5s."
These are just superb from start to finish build quality is excellent sound is outstanding the case to keep them in just everything about them is fantastic
Even better sound and noise cancellation than the previous model and the xm4’s were already amazing.
"Purchased a pair of these for commuting, the noise cancelling is superb, I find them very comfortable and excellent sound quality, well worth the money"
"Long story short: these headphones are really, really good. The sound quality is superb. As an avid music listener, I feel super spoiled when listening to my favorite songs with these--the sound is crisp and the base and treble are just right. The noise canceling is impressive as well--I live in a rather noisy urban environment, and these headphones do a fantastic job of blocking garden-variety white noise and even louder sounds like construction. The design is sleek and sophisticated, and the headphones are lightweight for the size. Overall, I adore these headphones and highly recommend this pair if you are in the market for some new ones!"
"Great and classy product, lightweight and superb noise cancellation. I have 2 issues (doesn't have nfc and it doesn't have an atom of water resistant whatsoever). It's super comfortable and I can wear it for very long hours without feeling fatigued. Connecting the device to your phone through the sony app should be the best features to enjoy.  It can select different ambient sounds based on your location."
"Very comfortable, light, great sound quality. Very easy to set up"
"the sound quality is fantastic. I love the touchpad options it makes it so much easier than trying to find the correct button.  The sound dampening is amazing, you can't hear anything when this feature is turned on.  The only thing I wish was a little better was how loud the volume can go, and the bass in the headphones.  Other than that, these are the best set I have owned thus far."
Absolutely beautiful and all around superb quality. The noise canceling is the top of the line . Cushion is the best . The light weight of these headphones are what I love the most . The feel of them everything is top of the line . Bass is impeccable and charging is fast and lasts so long . I’m beyond impressed with these and will definitely be staying with them and this brand .
"Most comfortable NC headphones I've won!
Easy to set up and  especially impressed with no plastic packaging!"""
"I've only had the product for about a week now. So far from my ungrade from the M2 there is no going back. I can't say much in terms of sound quality of but m5 sound way better to me but these are on train ears, I also feel the the noise cancelling is by far away better but again I'm not a professional. What I can say for certain is when taking a phone call all the clarity on both ends is way better. My 1 negative is I do believe the price is a bit high maybe £300 instead of £380 would be a better price point."
"Having used it over a month, and taking with me on travel I can say that this headphones is it! More than twice expensive headphones do not even come close."
"Great quality, and brilliant sound quality, very comfortable"
Great sound cancelling and that's what I wanted them for. The only flaw I can find is the fear of sweat breaking them .
"I bought these headphones as I wanted to be able to have good sound quality, decent mic for calls, and long lasting battery for those journeys when you just want to shut all the noise out. These headphones do a good job as they are comfortable, they stay on your head quite firmly if walking, though I will say these are not sport headphones.

The sound itself is very crisp and clear, much clearer than the previous XM4s I had. The bass has been cleaned up and I no longer have muddled bass in genres such as death metal or any genre which needs clear, well separated sound. I found the XM4s to be too bass orientated but these do a much better job in my opionion.

I don't use the touch functions so I can't comment on this. I would recommend if you are looking to have music which may lack the 'oomph' of the XM4s but in favour of a cleaner more balanced sound with these."
Not had the headset long but so far very impressed. Easy to use and great sound quality. Not fully tested the noise suppression but it is looking good so far. Quite a bid headset but folds nicely into the included zip box.
I've been using it for 3 weeks. It's great. Amazing sound quality. Good EQ options. Noice cancellation is okay. All features are great. App works perfect. But I found some problems when connected to my laptop. But it's fine now. overall I'm happy
I’ve got both the 4 and the 5 now and both brilliant but the 5 much more comfy and the Bluetooth connectivity much better
"I've had the WH-1000XM3s, the WH-1000XM4s and now these.  I didn't want to upgrade as I was very happy with the XM4s.  Glad I did as the XM5s are even better.  Didn't think it was possible!"
"So far so good , using in the gym and sounders good, little lose fit when running … sound cancelling is 2nd to none"
"Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones are the best headphones on the planet in my humble opininon. They exude high clarity of detail, have industry leading built-in technology and are superb for walking, resting, passive listening or detailed purist acute listening whichever catergory you may fit best. DSEE & Ambient & Noise Cancelling capabilities make these the choice to purchase as an outstanding product at the cutting edge of latest technology. Try them for yourself I can find no fault even if I wanted to. This is an impartial review and gets my highest commendation to date of products reviewed. One word . . . Enjoy!"
"These headphones are the best I’ve ever bought
They are light comfortable and sound fantastic 
Very pleased"
"WH-1000XM5 has a more balanced frequency response compared to the WH-1000XM3. It also does a better job with noise canceling. I really enjoyed the fact that you don't feel as much pressure in your ears due to the ANC, and I find myself using the headphones microphone this time around due to the improved microphone and it does a decent job at canceling the surrounding noise. The added features makes this headphones easier to use and it seems to be more responsive to inputs."
"Had to settle for the black ones since the silver/white ones I really wanted were not available. Other than that, these items are great. Sound quality is awesome, full bass, especially when you use them with the LDAC codec. Unfortunately this high quality codec is only available at the expense of multipoint Bluetooth connection, hope Sony makes it possible to connect multiple devices while still using LDAC.
The noise cancelling is great, creates a scary silence around you lol."
"My first impression was how light they are but without appearing to be at all flimsy. Pairing to my PC could not have been easier all I had to do was put the headphones into pairing mode and a message popped up on the PC asking if I wanted to pair. Connecting to the iPhone was almost as easy with just a few extra button presses. On the iPhone I was able to listen to music but when I used the phone I could not hear anything. The solution was really simple, the telephone and music have separate volumes and the phone volume was too low. Phone calls work really well and the other party seem to be able to hear clearly. They are really comfortable to wear for extended periods because they are so light and there is very little clamping pressure on your head. 
My office is close to a busy dual carriageway and it is impossible to have the window open because of the traffic noise. Now I can have the window open and all I hear is a slight whoosh and if I play music the background noise is almost completely eliminated. It goes without saying that the sound quality is excellent and with the phone app you change the settings using the graphic equalizer to suit your own preferences. I am very impressed with these headphones and I look forward to using them for many years."
"I got these after doing a lot of research between various high end brands etc. and I can say that I have not been let down these are of exceptional quality, fantastic sound, and the noise cancelling is phenomenal. Well worth there money compared to other brands that are more expensive and less of the quality"
"I brought these a few weeks back and they are awesome, the sound quality is excellent I’m very pleased with them and a great affordable price."
I bought them since release date are an amazing pair of headphones.
"I bought this a week ago so when I’m in a plane I have silence on the way, they work and are of premier quality. The are so reliable and responsive to any commands."
"These headphones have enabled me to do household tasks and be on calls without the other person complaining of the noises. Before this I often had to stop doing such tasks due to complaints of disturbances.
The main reason for this being rated 4 and not 5 is because it is not comfortable to wear continuously for over 2 hours. I am able to wear my Sony WHCH700N for up to 5 hours comfortably and expected the same with these new ones too."
"I bought the headphones mainly to listen to music on aircraft. Absolutely brilliant Noise Cancelling, highly recommended"
I am so glad I got these Sony - WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones. They are amazing. They were so easy to set up. They are very comfortable to wear. They came in a great case to keep them safe. The noise cancellation works so well too. And the sound quality is top notch. These are the best headphones I have ever used. Definitely my new favorite.
"Bought this 2 days ago and can't put it down , would buy for friends"
Upgraded from in ear headphones so glad I did noise cancelling so much better
I prefer over the ear headphones compared to ear buds. These headphones are amazing! Noise cancellation is on point. The are so comfortable. They don’t pull my hair when I take them off. The sound quality is wonderful. They are cordless so I can put them on when I’m doing the dishes or cleaning. I am very impressed with these headphones. Sony really makes quality products. They hold a challenge well. My husband likes them a lot and he’s an ear bud person. 10/10 would recommend
Bought these headphones just over a week ago and I am delighted with them.
"Bought 3 weeks ago. Recommend you spend time studying feature settings before purchasing and then personalising though they works adequately out of the box. Personal issue is these lack clarity (sound woolly to my expectation at this price point), compared to Bxxx mid price range - important for positioning and hearing the nuances of classical musical instruments, especially in orchestral pieces. ANC is excellent - in my experience, more effective range than Bxxx for dealing with ambient sound. 
Recommendation -- Yes to a friend, so long as the ""living presence"" in concert halls or large buildings is not a high priority."
"Got this just, 2weeks and am loving it. Quality sound and easy going"
"I bought 1000xm4 last year due to some reason I sold it though I enjoyed it very much but the call audio wasn't great,I bought 1000xm5 this year july 2023 and im enjoying the great features I love Sony 1000xm5"
"Previous models are more comfortable. If you wear glasses these make a rubbing creaking sounds around the leather surround on the ear. It's actually annoying and frustrating.

The top head band is thinner and less cushioned that older models and less comfortable for longer periods. Unable to use dual bluetooth if you want LDAC and high quality which is the whole reason you just spent nearly £400 on these headphones. So all in all actually feel disappointed, the MX3s were pretty decent albeit mine are falling apart after a few years usage."
I love everything abut the new edition. The only thing missing from my old XM3 is the NFC connection feature.
I absolutely love the Sony noise canceling headphones. They block out noise very well. I love that it has built-in Alexa and I can listen to my favorite music anytime. I never miss a phone call or notification because it will let you know when you have notifications. The built-in Alexa allows you to call someone whenever by simply asking. They fit so comfortably that you could wear them all day if you wish. The cushions are thick and fit snugly around the ears to block unwanted noise. Set up was very simple with easy to follow instructions by scanning the QR code provided. Very well constructed with obvious comfort and convenience in mind. They will come in very handy for us because our back yard is an interstate highway just beginning construction. My husband loves them too and is planning on using them when mowing and weed eating the lawn. They will come in handy when using his chainsaw to trim the many trees in the yard. They will work great for the woodwork he does too. I'm happy they will protect his hearing while working with loud tools and machinery. I will enjoy them while gardening or anytime. I can play music while working around the house without waking my husband when he's working nights. It makes me a happier person while listening to my favorite music. It's so easy by simply asking it to play what I'm in the mood to hear. Sound quality is great. I would recommend the Sony noise canceling headphones because you can listen to your favorite music and never miss a notification or phone call and it blocks out loud noise. It makes life much more enjoyable while protecting your hearing.
Not had a lot of time with these headphones as yet but so far very impressed with the sound. Best wireless cans I've heard to date
I tried Sony-WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones.  These are by far the best set of headphones that I've ever used. The sound quality is amazing. I listen to mostly hard rock and heavy metal music and with these phones you can hear everything that's happening. They are comfortable and have excellent range. I wear while doing housework and receive reception throughout the entire house.
"On a recent flight I found that the noise cancellation for engine noise to be phenomenal. It sounded as if we'd started gliding. Voice noise remained quite audible, which was annoying. 

The sound itself, from audiobooks through classical and dance music, is beautifully presented too."
"I bought it and sounds good but one issue is the noise cancellation is an average and has no foldable flaps like in xm4. But, superior sound and great features for xm5."
"I bought this some few weeks ago, I've not really used it but i like it so far"
"As someone with ADHD I had the opportunity to get my employer to purchase me new over ear headphones so I decided to upgrade from the 1000XM4 to 1000XM5. I already had the app in use to optimise the sound so haven't noticed any particular uplift in sound quality but I wouldn't have expected that. The headphones are lighter and more comfortable and the carry case is far more practical/usable. What knocks points off these headphones - and Sony headphones full stop - is the absence of re-usable and recyclable batteries for these headphones. I'm quite baffled by the headphone producing industry and Which (and other groups) reviews which give these producers thumbs up despite being so eco-unfriendly. Not cool. These headphones are pretty durable bits of plastic (my now 4 year old WH-1000XM4s are still going strong) and I would happily pay for an upgrade of those in functionality - rather than paying way more bucks for a lighter headset etc... When the time comes, I would rather see the battery replaced or refurbished within the headset than dumping the headset (we can pretty much guarantee that this headset isn't going to be ""recycled"" - unless that means burned). 

Sony I hope will change - and quick smart. The future is now. We all have a responsibility, but major organisations like Sony need to take the lion's share of responsibility. ASAP."
"really comfortable, really good quality audio and fantastic ANC.  When I take these headphones off, it's incredible how loud the outside world is.  Would be good if they could be packed more compactly, however I realise that it may compromise the physical structure."
"Bought these due to the reviews on line. Yes they are a little more expensive, they have a great sound and have a good case included."
These sony wireless noise canceling headphones are absolutely amazing. These headphones really rock my world. They have no issues connecting to my phone. The music is super loud and comes through very clear. They are very comfortable and are most definitely the best at noise canceling. You have the ability to turn the noise canceling off even. Just by slightly rubbing your finger on the side of the headphone you can change the volume and change song/fast forward/rewind. Also my favorite feature is that they stop playing if you take them off your head and automatically resumes once you put them back on.
"I bought these headphones about a month ago and have used them every day for work calls via Teams, listening to music while out walking my dogs and for a couple of flights. The sound quality is excellent, as is the noise cancellation. The app has a lot of features but the fact there are 2 separate apps is a bit confusing and also the main app for controlling the speakers is a little fiddly, although this is due to the number of features it has. Firmware updates have been provided regularly and they do take quite a while to complete, I imagine this is due to them being brand new and so will be less frequent as the app and headphone firmware has been around for a bit longer.

They're comfortable to wear for long periods due to the soft cushioning on the earpieces and the fact that they are quite lite. They are quite large, so not the best for running but jogging, walking and most exercise they seem to be ok. I just found that fast movement (eg running) they will slip a little / you can feel them.

Microphone quality is really good and doesn't seem to pick up any background noise which is useful as I use them for work calls all day.

They charge quickly and the charge lasts a long time, I use them at least a couple of hours a day, usually a lot more, and only charge them once a week."
Lov it. Good design................................
I bought these about 3 weeks ago as soon as they came in the post I knew they wernt for me as I have a square head shape they didn’t look right at all I’d advise going out to a shop and trying them on first instead of buying them online
One of the best headphones ever. Better than AirPods Max for sure
"Bought just before 2 long haul flights, I paired the headphones with a Bluetooth connector and was able to watch movies and listen to music over 26 hours (using a power pack while in transit to boost the battery).
The headphones were very comfortable, even when worn for several hours straight, much more so than the ones on the airlines, and the sound was excellent. i set up the app in a few minutes and mastered the controls via the headphones very easily."
"Exceptional noise cancelling, beautiful rich sound. Don't change a thing Sony! Xm5 over ear headphones"
"I got these in the mail a few days ago and i love love love these headphones! The noise cancelling is crazy, it has button so you can activate it and you cannot hear a thing! It also has other features like shortcuts to spotify and it has a touch pad so you can control the music as well as the  music volume. I hope to be able to test more Sony products in the future!!!"
"Quality, quality, quality, outstanding sound and background noise suppression - no need to say more!"
"The headset is well made, the sound quality and ANC is amazing. Also I was pleasantly surprised from the mic performance. Even in busy streets and with wind I can be heard on the other end. Comparing to jabra elite e75 and jabra 85t which I also own there is no comparison. I removed one star because of the price. They are very expensive."
"I bought these a couple weeks ago, very good sound nice battery life the Touch Is good."
I brought it today. And i have to day wow this is fire. I love it best headphone to buy right now
Doesn't work while charging and mics don't work while using aux wouldn't be a problem but this makes it non compatible with playstation. Also don't like the adjustment it is smooth but has no numbers so every time I take it out I need to repeatedly try to get it to fit right
"These headphones are incredible, in terms of their performance etc but the build quality does worry me, the part where the band joins the headphone could be done in metal to make sure it doesn’t brake."
I’m enjoying premium music sound and details voice with the extra functions that comes with it
"I bought mainly for using on long travel trips, the noise cancelling is great and the headphones are amongst the most comfortable I have ever used so perfect for long flights. Sound quality is up there with much more expensive headphones"
"These headphones are outstanding for sound, noise cancelling, and battery life.  Unlike all previous headphones I have owned, these cannot be used while charging.  This can be a little annoying if the battery dies when I have 10 minutes left in a movie.  Fortunately, they charge very quickly.  It is disappointing that the app only works on a cell phone.  I use these primarily with my computers and TV, so I cannot take advantage of all the features that might be available through a phone.  The build quality is rather flimsy.  The padding on the headband started peeling off at 2 months, and the right unit snapped off at 3 months (today), making them useless.  As one of the most expensive headsets in this category, I expected something a little more sturdy.  I will contact Sony about this tomorrow to see if they stand behind their products, and then I will revise my review as needed."
"I had been tossing and turning about whether to invest in the wh-1000xm5 headphones, and I bought them in December. 
They're reaaaly good. The features using the ap is super.
I use them virtually every day. I'm very happy with them. Fabulous."
"I bought these expecting a big improvement over the XM4. While the headphones are comfortable, they are so far the worst experience I've had in terms of connection issues. Ever since I bought them and after factory resets and upgrading the firmware, every time I join a new call the audio drops and my mic is gone. I've tried multiple devices with the same experience. The only way to make them work is to join the meeting and THEN turn the headphones on. And this is only with one device connected, as soon as I have two connected devices it makes it worse. Support has been very poor, as I've had conflicting suggestions and solutions to this problem."
These are excellent headphones with incredible noise cancellation capabilities. Really pleased with them
"This is my first time using a noise canceling head set and I'm very impressed.  The quality of sound is amazing. I absolutely like that it detects if you take the head set off your ears that it pauses what you're listening to. The battery lasts up to 30 hours, which is great. It is very easy to set up the app to your phone and it is not hard to use. It fits nicely over my ears and its comfortable.  The only issue I have is the suction over my ears. My ears ended up having a little discomfort and had a slight headache, but that just can be that I could have sensitive ears. I am very happy with this product and would recommend to anyone."
"I read a lot of reviews about these headphones and they made me buy them but unfortunately I get a vibrating rattle from the left cup.
But when the rattling stops then the sound is amazing and I'm really happy with them.
I'm hoping it's just my headphones and not all and once I've taken them apart I'll be able to fix the rattling, so yes I would recommend these to anyone."
Amazing features! Super lightweight! Great noise cancelling!
The right side hinge got broken after a week of use. I have used it will great care. Still the product is broken. It is definitely a design flaw
"Got these set of cans a couple days back. I'm not a ""huge"" audiophile, but I have used high end headphones in the past, ranging from high end gaming headsets to high end sennheiser and AKG headphones. But those need proper equipment to run, costing upwards of a couple hundred pounds. And a lot of these headphones let a lot of noise in, so you don't get any privacy. But with my sony wh-1000 xm5's I put them on, they pair immediately. Sound great and have amazing noise cancelling. My only complaint is the earpads, they are very comfortable but I find they aren't massively breathable and attract sweat easily, they could also be a bit deeper. I have ear piercings and I find that after multiple hours of wearing my ears might get a bit irritated, unlike my sennheisers I use at home."
I bought this a month ago and I'm so happy that I did!  The Sony wireless noise canceling headphones deliver great sound quality and I love listening to music around the house.  I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for quality headphones!
"Tried demo model versus the comparable high end Bose version in John Lewis. The Sony had noticably better noise reduction and the ear cups were larger, giving more space around the ear, which means little contact to the ears, which  would have irritated my skin. The cushions are very soft and do not push hard on the skill. I wear them for hours watching TV in great comfort.  Ears do get a little moist due to it being a sealed cup but it's unavoidable with over ear headphones.

I would prefer if they were a little firmer in sealing as this improves the Noise reduction but then comfort might be compromised.

Updating software was straightforward and with their app one can use the equaliser to adjust frequencies.

They do not cancel all external noise, if your hoping they will, as I was.  They are good though and better reduction than an equivalent prized Bose model ( can't remember model). Sony's noise reduction is about 30-33db, I use 37db ear defenders for work and the Sony are a little less than them.  However, 37 db is the highest available for ear defenders, I d hoped noise cancelling was just that.

Sounds very nice out of the box. I have not used them on blue tooth only plug in lead. 

They will work on a lead with no power or powered off but sound is obviously more basic. They can be used just to remove most background noise with no music at all, if you just want to son out in a noisy place/office.  

I think they would be to roomy and not tight enough for people with smaller heads. Mine is a good size, quite what's in it is debatable."
Happy I bought these headphones. Worth every penny.
"Excellent product, quality, really enjoying it at the moment"
"Got two weeks ago replacing my xm4s- like the smaller size looks and feels better to wear -  not overly tiring on longer wear periods either which I found could be the case with the previous model- did find it challenging at first to get the correct air tight fit but once achieved the noise cancelling is excellent a definite improvement, and as said the fit is definitely better which I found especially good when walking. They produce a good well balanced sound which can be tweaked and personalised with the in app Equalizer which is also a plus. Would absolutely recommend."
"My husband bought these headphones two weeks ago and is very happy with them, but would like a longer lead so that he can sit further away. Would appreciate advice so that we buy the correct type of extension lead or longer lead. He also wants a splitter so that we can both listen to music - same advice needed! HELP, please!"
Nice product    no paper instructions    find it yourself on google or miss out on aome features
"I’ve Had them since 2022 and they are simply amazing. I wear them most days for hours at a time and I never tire of them as their features, comfort and sound quality is outstanding"
"Bought the WH1000 MX 5 to replace my MX3 
Great sound & improved features, very impressive"
I bought this several days ago and they sound really good. Easy to set up and use.
"I’m very happy with this product. The quality is not so good as my wired Grado 350, but it is still the best wireless product. Better than Apple headphones which cost almost twice."
"I bought Sony noise cancelling headphones and I’m really pleased with the quality. It is my best purchase so for.
The excellence of this product is amazing. 
Also the fact that it can pair with my iPhone is great.
I never go to the gym without them. I feel that I’m training even better, because music is everything for me."
I brought this product last week to enable me to use the sound on my iPhone/iMac without disturbing anyone else in the room. It works a treat and can still talk to people whenever I like!
Bought these a few weeks ago as an upgrade from some earbuds I used for work. The noise cancellation and other features are brilliant and really help me focus on work tasks even with laundry machines running in the same room.
So so good - never had noise cancellation like it - incredible battery life - simply THE best can’t ever!!
"Checked perfectly with Bluetooth and noise cancelling was excellent. Then tried to use them on a long flight through the 3.5mm jack socket using the cable provided and found that was hopeless. I had left channel only, right channel only, or both only with the plug in exactly the right position. If that was disturbed by slight movement then the noise cancelling would switch off. Totally frustrating and they're going back for exchange."
"bought on sale for 299 very happy, amazing sound quality and noise cancelling is scarily good all in all happy bought this and not studio 3s"
"Sony WH-1000XM5 has an excellent quality on sound, product and presentation! Again, Sony doesn’t disappoint. The product presentation was high class. The case that stores the headphones is super nice and has a spot for the cables. Let’s get to the good part, sound. The noise canceling was very noticeable. The sound is, quality to the max! I watched a movie and it was great, I took a phone call and it was great. The phone call, person on other end could kinda hear a conversation going on in background (about 6ft away) but my voice was the more prominent. I love the memory foam cushions around the ear and headband which makes for hours of listening time. Connection to my phone was a breeze."
I purchased the headphone and it worked decently but it seems to be poorly made and one of the side starting chipping out for no reason and I am not even a heavy user. The only reasonable explanation could highly likely the poor manufacturing process and materials.
"I've only had the headphones for a couple of weeks but early impressions are they are excellent. The fit is very comfortable on the top of the head and the noise counselling is just outstanding when compared to my old Bose headphones (which admittedly must be 10 years old and are still superb). 
Listening to music on them is also very good but you do need to use the app in order to get the best sound.
The only thing I dislike about them is the fact that they don't fold up, rather than just fold flat."
Bought this a month ago. Works great sounds great. First Sony product and I am pleased.
"I have had cabled headphones but theses are my first bluetooth headphones. I am continually amazed at what the headphones are capable of. Connecting to my paired devices so easily, quality of sound, noise cancelling, pausing netflix if I remove the headphones, sound control and so much more. Although expensive for me well worth the money."
"Well I've tried noise cancelling head phones before and ear buds. But these really do, do what they say they do. I have heating issues and wear hearing aides and using these with my mobile and my laptop for meetings had been revolutionary"
"Really good, exceptional in most aspects, sound quality is unreal, however product feels slightly flimsy and is not water resistant (which would be nice) . Other than that would definitely recommend"
"I really love my new sony earphones. The NC is amazing, with a lot of cool and good working features. I would definitely buy them again. Only problem is, they are too big for my head. I‘m female, hat size 56 cm. I consider my head pretty average for a woman. The earphones won’t get „short“ enough to sit firmly on my head. And the stuffing is a little poor. So I can’t dance wildly, but sitting near the noisy road, listening to nothing but my music is worderful."
"Got these for Christmas and they have excellent sound separation and noise cancelling. The sound quality is superb - no muddy base and the low ends do not drown out the mids. Also, the NC is excellent and happily drowns out my younger brother talking."
"After a month using the headphones I'm very happy with them, great features and long battery for a long day"
"The headphones audio quality is good, they look great but the build quality isn't good. The head detection feature keeps breaking over and over again. I work from home sitting on a desk and they still broke. If you're looking for headphones that you'd want to wear outdoors, don't even think about them."
"These headphones are amazing! Definitely get the app, comes with a lot of helpful information. Easy to link to my phone, and the sound is great. Highly recommend."
"I absolutely love these headphones. The sound is fantastic. I also use them in my noisy office and they work brilliantly for noise cancelling and meetings. My only issue is the headband. It's very narrow considering how heavy the headphones are, and I find after a few hours it hurts the top of my head. If I move the band slightly to a new spot it helps, but it gets really uncomfortable after extended periods."
"Brilliant sound quality from these Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones and so easy to set up and use. Some very good features for controlling the sound and the world around you … speak to chat, ambient sound and noise cancelling … and all operated by tapping the right earpiece (this takes a bit of getting used to but, with a little practice, it works well)."
"ANC is still not good enough. 
Mic can not be connected through the line, you have to use the Bluetooth connection to use the mic.
The design of the rotation direction of the two headphones is terrible.
I like the multi-connection function with Bluetooth!"
"I purchased my first noise cancelling headphones in 2017 and, after a significant amount of research decided on the MDR-1000X. I have been extremely happy with the quality of these products to the extent that I then purchased my wife a pair of WH-1000XM3, the upgraded version of my headphones in 2019. We were both extremely happy with the design, comfort, ease of use and quality of the products. The main reason for purchasing them was for travelling, and making long-haul flights more enjoyable without the distraction of the plane and other background noises. The WH-1000XM5 are, however, a significant step up from these previous products.
Firstly, the headphones feel significantly lighter, which is always a plus for travelling.
The previous versions used to fold away into their carry case with a bit of twisting, which I always was worried about in case of getting it wrong, having to double check each time that I folded the correct ear. To be fair, it was easy enough, but with this pair, there is no need for this and they simply fold flat back into their case, which makes easier The carry case is a bit bigger, which therefore takes a bit more room in your hand luggage, but has room within it for all cabling (audio and charger), which is a good.
I actually think the latest version are more comfortable as well - but it is marginal.
I always felt noise cancelling was great on the previous product and it is equally so on the new version. The big plus for me is that there is now no need to run the noise cancelling optimiser for different surroundings. OK, it was fairly simple by pressing a button, but it took about a minute to complete. There is no need for this with the XM5's, as apparently they auto optimise based on your surroundings - which is great.
There are other new features that you have to get used to:
- the headphones automatically pause what you were listening to when you take them off, and restart when you put them back on - confusing at first when testing, when you think you must have pressed something by accident, but it is a feature which is quite useful
- similarly, if you start speaking, the headphones recognise this, pause your music and switch to ambient mode so you can hear - ideal for when you are asked if you want a drink on the plane!
Apparently you can pair the headphones to 2 devices simultaneously, in case you are listening to music on a laptop but want to still receive calls!? That is not really relevant for me, so I have not tried it.
Battery life is claimed at 30 hours and a 10 minute charge apparently provides 5 hours of battery use. Again, I cannot validate these figures - but have not experienced any issues. In short, they charge quickly and last a long time!
Sound quality is pretty important when buying headphones and this is where they come into their own, and I personally think they offer a much fuller sound than my original 1000X, with impressive bass. They are a real step up.
In summary, these are really excellent headphones from every perspective and I was pleasantly surprised at how they improved on what I previously thought were perfectly adequate 1000X. I am very happy that I have the new ones, especially as now we can fly again so hopefully I will get chance to use them more often."
"Received these as a gift after Christmas. Having had many pairs of headphones and earphones over the years, these are the best ones I have ever had. The noise cancelling element is second to none. Still working through the different aspects of the headphones."
Excellent headphones. After months of re-search I went with the XM5s and they are the best. Just what I wanted
"These headphones are amazing and I would strongly suggest them to anyone looking for a great audio experience. They are light and deliver crisp and rich sound. They also fit very well and feel comfortable even after wearing them for hours. I have tried other popular headphone brands, but none of them can match the Sony headphones in terms of comfort, sound quality, design and value."
"Blown away by the sound quality and noise cancelling! Seriously good headphones. Love the style too, sleek and minimalist. Would recommend"
"The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones deliver an exceptional listening experience perfect for music enthusiasts, gamers, and travelers. Their outstanding sound quality features crisp, clear audio and a rich, deep bass that elevates every genre of music. The noise-canceling technology effectively drowns out background noise, allowing users to fully immerse themselves in their audio content without distractions.

Comfort is a key strength of the WH-1000XM5 headphones. The generously padded ear cups and adjustable headband ensure a snug, comfortable fit for all head sizes. Their lightweight design allows for extended use without discomfort. The sleek, stylish appearance and foldable design make these headphones a versatile accessory for any outfit, while the premium carrying case provides added protection. The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones excel in sound quality, noise-canceling, and comfort. If you're seeking a new pair of headphones, the WH-1000XM5 is a top choice that won't disappoint."
"Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones

The Sony WH-1000XM5 are so impressive featuring new drivers with flagship superb features and design, active Noise Cancelling (ANC) Fantastic for home, office, travel the list is endless. Optimised for Alexa and Google Assistant.

The headphones are covered in a soft coating leatherette they are very comfortable to wear. One of the first things you notice when you open the box is the environmental packaging It's unbleached and wholly recyclable and uses no plastic whatsoever. The headphones are made mostly from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) which is useful material in acoustic terms which is mostly produced from recycled plastic and can be recycled again at the end of its life. So full marks to Sony for doing this.

The Sony WH-1000XM5 main controls use capacitive touch panel on the right ear cup with actions as follows:

Swipe Up = Volume Up
Swipe Down = Volume Down
Swipe Forward = Track forward
Swipe Back = Track back
Hold (Centre) =Voice assistant

Cup hand =. Ambient sound pass through

On the left ear cup you will find two buttons, a power button and ANC mode button.Hold down the power button turns the headphones on after three seconds pairing will start, after that you can pair with your phone/computer.

 If you press NC/AMB button you can toggle the ANC mode, you are able to select the ANC/ANC off. The Ambient sound mode lets you hear what’s going on around you.

You connect the headphones via Blue tooth or a TRS cable. When you listen to the WH-1000XM5 via the wired connection you turn the headphones on and that enables the ANC or leave them off. They sound quite different in passive mode.

At the bottom right is a USB-C Charging port that allows you to charge the headphones.

The Sony Headphones Connect App works great with these headphones and I highly recommend that you download it. Also you can get the latest updates for your headphones.

Battery life for these Sony headphones is approx 30 hours on a full charge, if  the battery is flat you can charge for just 3 minutes you will get 180 minutes of playback or of course you can always use the 3.5mm cable for analog playback.

The headphones  tend too boost the bass a bit too much with a detriment of the midrange however by using the App you can use the equalisation feature to tailor to your liking. 

These Sony Headphones support Sony’s high bit rate codec called LDAC which gives very good sound quality. 

On using the wired connection I found the sound performance identical to the wireless mode but you need to make sure they are powered on, if you listen in passive mode performance is not so good.

The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones sport 8 microphones and the call quality is good and is excellent on zoom calls or phone meetings. It rejects outside noise well.

Overall these Sony headphones are a great buy but expensive, but if you want the best they are definitely worth the outlay."
Beautiful design combined with smart features and bulletproof durability.  Battery life stunning as usual Sony product.(Photo taken with Sony Xperia 1 IV)
"I've been using these headphones for about ten days and I couldn't be happier. The sound image is great - I've been enjoying listening to music with more clarity and hidden details that I didn't hear before. The bass, in particular, is excellent if that's your thing."
"We did a lot of research on noise cancelling headphones and these had the best reviews, i have tried others but they were not good. These are amazing it really blocks out all the background noise. For those days that i just need to focus on work with no distractions. I highly recommend these"
I recommend you to buy a xm4 or even xm3. It isn't worth so much money.
"Sony 1000XM5 Noise Canceling Headphones are truly amazing. The sound quality is like no other it’s crystal clear and you really can hear the acoustics unlike other headphones. They are light weight and fit very comfortably on my head the ear cushions don’t smush my ears. 
The battery life is another wonderful feature, the headphones can last me days before needing to be charged. The noise canceling aspect is perfect you can’t hear a thing when they are on. This is great when you want to tune out or have to focus on something and can’t be distracted. 
Sony these are amazing!!"
"Got this for Christmas. The quality is amazing. Easy to use , very versatile"
"I bought this in October 22 as a Christmas present. They worked well from December through to late October, sound quality was good and the noise cancelling was also good. However the headphones developed a technical fault in late October 23 (any headphone enthusiast knows the dreaded 'popping' a cup develops when there's a hardware issue) and Sony have been less than helpful since the warranty was 2 weeks over the year. As they were a Christmas present the headphones had only been in use for 10 months. I've been a Sony customer since the XM2s, but this will be my last set of headphones from them."
"The look was amazing,  it was indeed smarter and  a better mic-call quality with ANC. Just one thing that made me wanted to return it was the so called wider sound stage , it made the sound signature terrible compared to XM4. I could not believe my ears, i 
think it's  underwhelming for £379.
The fact that water resistance still NOT considered for this pair of cans in 2022 is amazing. 

Overall, this is a really smart and great looking 
headphone, if you aren't sound freak you 
definitely would love it."
Are a good pair of noise-canceling headphones. Lightweight and extremely comfortable.
"These are an early Christmas present for me, the first over-ear wireless headphones I’ve had, chosen because of the reviews testifying to very good sound quality, good noise cancellation, comfort and battery staying power. 
I’ve had them a couple of weeks and have used them most days, mainly in the evening but occasionally walking around doing things in the house - not used them outside.
Mostly I’ve listened to music but I’ve heard a couple of podcasts too. The sound quality is lovely - the effects of tracks from Jean Michel Jarre where sound switches from one side to the other and back is reproduced brilliantly and the delicate background noises of trees rustling and goats on tracks recorded outside by Ballake Sissoko playing kora are fabulous. The human voice is a rich sound too, again with no apparent loss with even breathing audible on tracks where it was meant to be heard.
Battery life seems very good. They arrived with about 60% charge and I recharged them when they got down to about 20% but that took about 10-14 days’ use of maybe 2 hours a day. No idea whether that’s good in comparison to others but certainly good enough for me.
The set up was easy, noise cancellation is excellent from what I can make out, but I find the ability to pause this temporarily to head what someone is saying to me particularly helpful - just hold a hand over the right earpiece, ambient sound is restored very quickly and clearly, remove the hand and the music resumes. 
The headphones are comfy to wear, easy to adjust and while not tight, they seem to stay out so far when I’m bending down.
The only very minor negative is that my ears get quite warm after I’ve worn them for about 1-2 hours, so I’m not sure I’d want them on for really extended periods. But that would be the same or worse for all headphones so no difference for these and I suspect other models might not be as comfortable. 
It’s true there are no free lunches and you get what you pay for, but with these I feel I’ve got good value for money. 
They come in a protective case which also contains the charging cable, and the app might be useful for connoisseurs wanting to tweak the set up but I’ve just used them with my music app on the phone. 
So, I’d say so far, so good."
"I did a direct comparison with the Bose 700 noise cancelling headphones and felt this had superior NC and an obverall better sound. Having had them for a few weeks now, I'm really pleased with the choice I made and the performance of the product. NC is excellent and the sound reproduction, particularly the way they handle bass is excellent. You won't regret it."
"I just bought it, at first it said that some features won't work with iPhone, but after I tried it, everything works well. The only feature that I still considered installing later, it's Alexa. Since this device only works with Alexa for the voice command. I hope the product will be able to update so that the user can use Google and Siri."
Amazing headphones and the design is simple and elegant
just brilliant product and the pair of headphones i bought Also have the Tv
I purchased the 1000xm5 after reading the What hifi reviews I was really sceptical as I would normally listen to phones before buying. But the reviewer was very appreciate about the product an the reviews by people who actualy bought them was good. The packaging was very good the headphones them selves are not flashy but rather understated I like the sound fresh from the box an the app is great because some of the streaming Audio tracks leave a lot to be desired overall an excellent quality product well done Sony.
I am really enjoying these headphones.  Setting up the headphones is easy through the associated app.  I haven't subscribed to any of the 360 Audio apps but the demonstrations are ridiculously good.  Total sound emersion. Even without this feature the sound quality is amazing.  The noise cancelling feature works great and I really love it for airplane travel.  The battery life is good and I haven't had to worry about charging them during the day.  The only downside is that these are not designed for use during workouts or any type of wet conditions.
"This is the best pair of noise cancelling headphones I have ever tried. Before getting these, I researched and tried almost every popular headphones in the price range and finally decided to stick to Sony. I should say so far, I am really impressed and happy with my purchase decision. Sound quality is excellent and noise cancellation is exceptional. Would have preferred to see an easily replaceable ear cushion but I hope that's nothing to be concerned about now. Audio output is a bit on the bass heavy side which I personally love but you can easily tweak it in the amazing companion app. Overall one of the best audio products I have ever own."
"After extensive use I can confidently say that Sony’s new WH-1000XM5 headphones are a tremendous leap forward from previous models and the competition.  The headphones themselves feel very sturdy and will not break from minor contact or pressure.  A big improvement from previous models is that these fold flat into their case in a very intuitive and natural manner, whereas older models I experienced required some twisting and I worried each time about exerting too much pressure and causing a break.  The weight seems much improved and even after hours of use I don’t experience any pressure points or fatigue on my head or ears.  My absolute favorite part of the WH-1000XM5 is the noise cancellation, which is superior.  The cancellation is adaptive and filters the majority of ambient or ancillary sounds without the need to run optimization.  For example, other brands I have used may filter the din of traffic and sidewalk sounds but when an ambulance zooms by its siren penetrates the level of active noise cancelling in place causing a startling intrusion of loud sound.  The WH-1000XM5 manages such abrupt changes in ambient sound perfectly and optimizes with immediate recalibration to the active filtration.  I have truly not experienced this level smart adjustment on any other brand or model except for Apple’s top model.  An additional feature that I absolutely love is that the headphones intelligently perceive when they have been removed and pause playback; and when put back on, playback resumes (perfect if responding to a quick question, waiter, etc.).  All of these features combine together to make the WH-1000XM5 my essential traveling companion.  As for sound quality, the WH-1000XM5 is impressive and consistent.  Bass is deep and strong, but not overbearing and never prone to distort.  Highs are crisp but not intrusive – I feel that they were likely tuned with a perfectly flat response, then a slight bass boost applied.  The result is perfect for my listening experience and I never EQ the sound playback that they receive.  In summary, I highly recommend the WH-1000XM5 and am confident that others will be as impressed with the features as I continue to be. "
I can hear voices and music amidst heavy traffic. The sound quality and bluetooth connectivity is excellent. I feel discomfort at the top of my head when I wear the headphones. Would a flatter design be better?
These are really good. The ANC is the best I’ve heard and the sound quality is equally good. The case is a good design but quite a bit bigger than the Bose equivalent.
"I accidentally broke 2 pairs of the XM4's but with the build quality of the XM5, I feel safer taking this on and off without breaking the metal/plastic band holding the headphones together. Sound quality is on another level but noice canceling could be a bit better compared to the Air Pods Max."
Bought these for travelling whilst working abroad. Brilliant in all aspects
Futuristic headphones that surprise you with new features I haven't seen before
I brought these a month ago after testing them in curry’s I wanted a pair of headphones with good bass and I found when testing them non really had that so I choose the Sonys just because of the clarity and fast response times of the carbon fibre drivers when I got them home and started using them I found they are very bassie and they were a good buy.
Impressed with the sound quality and other features.
"Wow, these Sony Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones are great.  They cancel out all noise, they feel so comfortable over my ears, they are very stylish.  They are made for iPhone/iPad and it also has Alexa built in. I highly recommend these Sony Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones."
"Good for the price too, ANC and ambience great so far"
"Excellent sound quality.  You can hear parts in music that has been inaudible on cheaper headphones or speakers.  Sound cancelling works extremely well.  Connects easily to my PC (with a Bluetooth dongle), phone and tablet."
I'm  happy with the Sony headsed WH-1000XM5 but expensive
"I have used quite a number of ear buds and headphones over a period of time; these are really fantastic! Why? Well to start with you can hardly tell you are wearing them as they are so comfortable; then there is the great features on switching them on, using voice commands and so much more just on a tap on the ear phone! The quality of sound is truly in depth and amazing clarity not to mention they are noise cancelling! Without doubt, using the mobile phone app with this phones really lets you fine tune then to your every moment atmosphere, where ever you may be travelling to, or just relaxing.... love these...."
"Excellent sound and NC, but wear sensor is broken by the latest firmware update (1.1.3). I've found lots of such cases on reddit. Tried reset and factory reset, but no luck. Will have to return my unit if no fix coming soon."
"These are truly headphones of the future. It was handy having them pause my music whenever I slipped them off to hear something in the house, I also liked the different controls that are right on the headphones themselves. I did notice that if I wore a thick headband or tried wearing them over a hat, they would go into standby mode as it couldn't detect if I was still listening. I consider that a good thing though, this standby mode preserved battery life whenever I took them off and forgot to power them down.

The design is extremely comfortable, I nearly forgot I was wearing them a few times. Not heavy at all very comfortable on the ears and sides of the head.

Lastly, I have to talk about the audio quality. I felt absolutely spoiled by how good everything sounded. I found myself using them for video games as well as music and immersive content like interactive audio or ASMR. These are hands down my favorite headphones for anything audio intensive."
These headphones have exceeded my expectations! These are light and comfortable. Easy to set up by Bluetooth or plugging in. They charge quickly and work so well that my husband had trouble using them to talk to clients because it was weird hearing himself. I did accidentally hit the subtle buttons a few times and the matte finish show fingerprints easier then I'd like but over these are amazing! My mom's begging to use them on her overseas trip.
"I bought the WH-1000XM5 on 2 minhs before for my proffessional use. The first 2 months were perfect and after that in one day, the right side of the headphone stops working. I tried to restart  , then rest the heaphone unfortunatly it didnt work. I have sent my headphone to the service.and its taling long time to get back to me. I have got lots of struggles in my career due to the lagging of servicing and i cant even work  as my job is fully related to customer service and ghe role of headphone is very important."
"Bought it last week, very easy to use , good noise cancelling"
"I must say this is a great headphone with amazing features. The noise cancellation is the top of the best. I used it in a very noisy area but no outside noise could interfere with my listening to music. Awesome sound quality and functionality. The ""Speak-to-chat"" is superb, once you start talking to someone, your music is paused automatically. I love this headphone."
These Sony - WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones work great. I love the design of them and how comfortable and lightweight they are. The sound is great and they do cancel out any other sounds. They charge quickly which is good. The case is also very nice.
Sound quality is amazing. Noise cancellation works perfectly. Very comfortable
"Tremendous had these for over a year, sounds and quality are 2nd to none"
"Bought from new from sevenoaks hifi in Yeovil somerset.
These headphones exceeded my expectations.
Having had many headphones from stax to audeze, grado, and sennheisers, these are just fantastic headphones outright, with warm but insightful sound.
Very comfortable, and amazingly light.
I bought them so I could listen to music in the living room when family in here watching TV, as my other headphones are open back and leak sound..
I use them alot more than I thought I would 
Good work sony!
Oh the noise cancelling... Simply wow! 
And love the feature where you cup your hand over the right speaker and not only does it mute the music, it increases the clarity of your own voice so it doesnt even sound like you have headphones, very clever."
Bought these bc the internet said they were the best.. and they were.. for a week. Left ear started having a constant loud crackling noise. Barely used them.. super bummed. Going to hopefully return them for a full refund.
"I brought these a month ago, the sound quality and noise cancellation are amazing. The problem is i mainly brought them for use with PC for calling. The issue id that the Bluetooth codec changes to an inferior one to save bandwidth and thus sound quality reduces dramatically therefore I'm an considering taking them back. To be fair i believe most if not all Bluetooth headsets do the same this is not unique to Sony. If you just want to listen to music then but, for voice application on the PC leave well alone."
"I have mainly used these headphones at home, plus whilst on holiday in Wales.
I have previously owned noise cancelling for about four years and although happy with them after about an hour they were not that comfortable!
However with these ones from Sony I feel like I could wear them for a long time (long haul flight).
The sound quality has to be heard to be believed, noise cancelling is very impressive, if someone speaks to you whilst using these headphones the sound & image pause, then restart’s after wards.
I would recommend that if someone wants a quality pair of headphones, try these."
"Sony who-1000m5 headphones

Had these phones for a week or so.
First impressions were that these are well built and extremely comfortable to wear,I kept them on for about four or five hours and they never felt uncomfortable or tight,very nice fit.I find that they work well on TV ,iPad and mobile phone.good USB c charging and audio cable.
They don't fold like my previous headphones,but they are quite compact and I was never sure if constant folding phones was a good idea anyway.They come in a nice case with cables enclosed.3Thirty hours from full charge and three minutes charge gives three hours life.
I did have a problem at first as the phones kept cutting out,every few seconds,I initialized them a couple of times and now they work fine.I tried them up to about sixty feet from mobile and they did well up to about fifty feet appx.
I am not a big audiofile, but I find the music is beautifully balanced and sounds like you are in the studio with the artists,so clear!even at higher volume.eight microphones and two processors give plenty of power.
You can also adjust settings to suit.
It is easy to switch between noise cancelling and ambient sound,and pairing was easy enough.Noise cancelling worked as expected,and a big step up from my other buds and headphones.
The right cup can be used to mute just by cupping your hand over it,handy if needed,right cup is used for volume ,next track etc and if you take off phones it pauses 
I don't phone much anymore,but found that phone call was clear,and did not feel echoey 

All in all I am very pleased,best headphones I have ever had,and I've had a few.I would thoroughly recommend,after all,they are Sony!"
"The crystal clear, full-bodied sound, and extremely effective noise cancelling, make these headphones an absolute gem!"
"I bought it two weeks ago.This has been a bucketlist of mine.I am pretty much happy about how the headphones work,they reworked the design,I previously had a wh-910n and that thing broke a few times due to the design,same issue with xm3 and 4 which they resolved in this.It is super comfy too and gives a luxury touch to it.

I would recommend this product."
"Only had them 2 days, probably spent to much time listening to them all ready. Can't believe the sound quality, the noise cancelling despite my skepticism is every bit as good as the reviews and Sony claim.
         To make it more clear, I've always been a Sennheiser or AKG headphones user, but a recent visit to a hifi store and with AKG being a bit useless now, prompted me to try Sony, Sennheiser's latest and Bowers and Wilkins. The sales person was kind enough to let me muck around with them all and use the apps to play with settings.
        As soon as I'd done the personalised EQ on the Sony app and put LDAC into highest mode, I started smiling the moment my music played using Qobuz. Within moments I was hooked, blew the competition away. 
     Everything I listen to has been presented in such a beautiful musical way. Bass kicks like a mule when needed, super taut and sub bass is excellent. The kids quality makes guitars/strings sound fabulous, treble is perfect. Vocals sound so rich and perfect for male or female vocalists.
       The app is an absolute joy to use, very easy to intuit your way through. The ANC is incredible especially to a first time wh1000 series user, no background hiss, and completely cocoons you in to the wonderful sound these are capable of delivering, very much a convert to the series, best Bluetooth headphones I've had out of about 18 sets. Sublime!"
"I wanted to save up and invest in quality headphones. The XM5's are incredible. Paired with the streaming quality of Tidal, the sound is out of this world good."
Wow... simply State of the Art.  This is an investment in my time...I am aged 70 plus and I still rock...thanks Sony.
"Delighted to have finally purchased these headphones. Trying to work from home was a nightmare with neighbours noise but now, I can focus and work in peace and quiet"
I bought this one month ago. Still questioning the style even if technologically this makes me smile
"Great sound through equaliser, lots of features ..."
"Just upgraded from xm3. Great sound and design, looking forward to many hours of listening"
"I bought the headphone on the airport of Amsterdam. The sound is great, nousecanceling super and easy to use."
"I love these awesome Sony headphones, light,feel great and the bass is amazing,I highly recommend them to everyone, Best noise cancelling I've ever had,they are so great,love them."
Amazing piece of kit. When it comes to headphones you can't beat them
"Great sounds, best bass I've experienced in ages. Magnificent cans at a great price"
"WH-1000XM5 works well if you want to listen to music in high quality. 
But the headset feature needs work. 
You speak louder as you can’t hear yourself. 
Also if you use the connect to two devices feature the mic stays on your phone and the headset connects to the pc making it useless for listening to music on your phone and using ur pc as teams vc"
"Very comfortable fit,super soft on the ears.Seems to be very durable product especially the headband. Sound quality is crisp and clear. The noise cancellation is very good! Battery life is very good at over 30 hours. has wear detection and speak to chat feature.Overall great product that I would recommend!"
"I am so happy with this sony headphones!! The sound quality is amazing, It’s so soft. The material is so soft and the features is great. You can skip or pause by clicking with your finger. It is so comfortable and has great noise cancellation. The design is so neat and stylish it has a clean look. The best thing about it is the cup is big and it didn’t hurt my ears. But the only thing concern about is the case holder is kinda big. Yet it is stylish and neat it has a magnet inside to hold your charger. Overall i am happy with it . And highly recommend it."
Hands down the best headphones I have ever used. I will never buy a different pair of noise canceling headphones. They are comfortable on the ears and fit different shaped heads perfectly.  I love the feature that allows you to talk and the music stops and after 15 secs of not talking the music continues! 10/10 recommend!
I purchased a Blu Ray player. Astonishing build quality and performance.
Really fun going out with my new gear. Loved its features.
"I always look forward to getting new tech. Less so, when I am replacing an item like for like due to a breakdown or fault. Less so too, if I’m just getting an upgrade to an existing piece of kit that I have. No, for me, the real excitement begins when I get a piece of tech that I haven’t owned/used before.

Step forth the Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise Cancelling Headphones. Sure I’ve had headphones, but not the noise cancelling variety. 

Resplendent and shiny new in what Sony describe as their environmental packaging initiative. No plastic in the packaging and the Product Box is made using Sony’s Original Blended Material. I took a further look in to this and it appears that the headphones are also made of recycled materials. I don’t tend to buy items based on their environmental credentials, but seeing the attention that Sony are giving to it, it clearly is something that a lot of people care about. I would even go as far as to say, it’s woken me up to the fact and I should be a little more considerate in my buying habits going forward.
 
The first impression you get is one of quality and environmental consideration. Nice one Sony. 
Once you get inside the box, which is worth keeping to protect your headphones case from future misdemeanours, you are greeted by a further case, this time in a grey hard cloth finish that is attractive and functional.

Undoing the gold zipper just helps build the anticipation and once fully opened you aren’t disappointed, though at first sight I am surprised at how little is in the case. But wait, those crafty folk at Sony have worked some magic and as I start to explore I realise that everything I need is in the pack. A discreet flap hides the location of the headphones cable and USB charging cable.

The first thing that strikes you is how beautifully styled the headphones are. Everything is colour matched in a quality matt black finish. They’re light and softly rounded rather than futuristically angular.They ooze quality.

Considering this was new tech to me, I was a little anxious about understanding and mastering it’s complexities. I needn’t have worried. The sleeve (Again in recycled material) that contains all the documentation shows a QR code that when scanned takes you to a User Manual for the headphones.
Next, download the Sony Headphones Connect App. Follow the instructions makes setting up the headphone's simple.

Sony have also included a variety of options that allow you to trial for free any one of four music streaming services that provide the 360 Reality Audio Experience. The good news is that the trials are for three months+ in most cases, giving you ample time to trial your chosen service. The concept of the 360 Reality Audio is that instead of you hearing the sound in just a stereo environment it is relayed to you as if you were in your very own musical sphere. I may not have done it justice with my description but I can promise you the most wonderful listening experience. Clarity and depth are the words that come to mind to describe it.   

To get the best listening experience you have to create your own personalised profile. Again, a  really simple experience that involves using an app to guide you. The app assesses the shape of your head and ears that allows the software to build a unique profile to enhance your  listening.

I saw a TV drama only a few days after I started using the WH-1000XM5’s and the lead character in it said she only listened to her music via headphones. Strangely, that is something I’ve begun doing myself since I got the headphones for all my music listening except when using the radio in the car.
 
The noise cancelling element of the headphones is brilliant. The first time I used them brought back to me a recent flight I took that lasted over four hours. Had I had the headphones then I would have used them to cut out all the background noise on the plane.  I fly about five times a year so they will be invaluable to enhance the quality of my journey.

In use, the headphones are simple to use. You can do most things by using the touch controls on the right headphone. You can play, stop, pause and skip through tracks while raising and lowering the volume just by moving you fingers in a particular direction. The same actions can be used when taking calls. If you cover the whole right headphone in the cup of your hand the sound is reduced to a mere whisper allowing you to listen more attentively to your surroundings. Combine this with the Ambient or noise cancelling button on the left headphone and you can alter the sound to include the local ambient noise or have noise cancelling on.

With music playing you can speak and the sound cuts out allowing you to hear your voice and locality more clearly. Any alerts on your phone are acknowledged with a sound in your headphones to keep you in touch with the rest of your social network.

Remove the headphones and the music playback pauses and restarts when you put them back on. So useful.

By now you may be beginning to realise how much I’ve fallen in love with my Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise Cancelling Headphones. I love them, and can’t believe I haven’t found myself searching them out before. 

I use them at my computer while working (Even wrote this review while using them). 

When my wife chooses to catch up on her soaps or talent shows of an evening I slip the headphones on and take myself to the immersive sound experience created by my WH-1000XM5’s.

However to conclude this review, a word of warning. When I started using them I found myself moving about the house singing along to the tunes I was listening to. I was having a great time until my enraged red faced wife tapped me on the shoulder and told me to stop the noise. Maybe Sony should put a warning on the packaging discouraging those of us that can’t sing to be mindful of others around us when we use them?"
"These Sony WH 1000XM5 headphones are amazing. I received my headphones was was very impressed with the sound quality. Sony has always been known for good sound quality, especially when it comes to headphones, so I was anxious to try them out when I received them. Mainly I use these headphones for gaming, but also for listening to music or watching videos. I was also surprised that these headphones came with a wireless mic as well. All in All I would recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a good set of headphones. Not only do these headphones have amazing sound and a wireless microphone along with Bluetooth, but they also have the ability to customize the sound via app. I would definitely recommend these headphones to anyone."
"This is a headphone investment.  The prices are comparable to others in this catagory.  The packaging is a sturdy cardboard nesting box and the headphones itself are in a secure slim profile pouch.  The instructions are easily accessible via a camera scan or on the web.  It takes a bit of time to update the software and compete setup so be sure to allow for that.  The headphones pair easily.  They are adjustable and very comfortable over your ears.  They can detect when you sit, walk, etc and adjust the sound accordingly.  The sound quality is excellent.  They are available in black or silver.  They fold easily for storage in their case.  I have not tried them for hands free calling yet but understand this is a feature of the product.  This is definitely a product to consider!"
"Bought these a few weeks ago and they are the best headphones I've ever had. They fit well and are comfortable even after hours of use. I work from home and use these to take calls, which the headphones work very well for. The noise cancelling is really good and the ambient mode is perfect - there's an option to adjust how much sound is passed through if you use the app. The app also has some good EQ modes and the difference between the modes are noticeable. All overhead headphones that I have used in the past never fit my head/ears properly but these fit perfectly. The ONLY negative that I have to say is that when they are on theres no light to show they are on - so if I dont have my phone I cannot tell from a glance if they are on or not."
"these are awesome headphones. This is a mega upgrade from my JBL headphones the quality is superb. I use these to listen to music and also to watch movies on my iPad and they provide premium sound quality when doing both. They are very comfortable and was easy to connect via Bluetooth. They provide a long battery life and charging time is fast. You can’t go wrong, these sound amazing."
Similar audio quality is available on much cheaper headsets.
Lovely headphones very easy to set up and to use and sound very good
"Bought this for Christmas, the noise cancelling is brilliant and haven’t had any problems so far. One thing that they could improve on is the transparency mode’s ability to hear people speaking. Can clearly hear surroundings while in this mode, but it’s still hard to hear other people when talking"
I bought this one month ago and feel satisfied as the overall experience met my high expectations
"Now I know why the call me a ""boomer"". These headphones are technically amazing.  I've always been a cheapskate when it comes to stuff like headphones. I didn't know what I was missing."
"I bought this 3 months ago, excited to upgrade from my previous Sony headphones. The design has definitely improved, and it feels sturdy despite the slimmer build. It folds flat, nice and compact in the equally sturdy case. There's USB-C support for charging, and it doesn't take too long to charge either -- but that's where the positives end. 

I'm a longtime fan of Sony headphones, but this pair is definitely my worst. Here's why:

- The noise cancelling is really, really bad. I was patient and waited for Sony firmware updates, and while Sony did tweak some of the settings, none of the updates since June have done the headphones any good in terms of noise cancelling *quality*. Sure, the headphones can now automatically change noise cancelling intensity based on location and movement, but the changes are now so  jarring and inconsistent, thus making the updates feel more like a massive downgrade. Here's a daily scenario: you walk to your bus stop, the headphones then switch to a different noise cancelling setting because it remembers that your local bus stop is a saved location (and if you haven't saved it, you'll receive an annoying amount of notifications for any of your regular locations, including any bus stops you're regularly at as part of your commute); you get on the bus, and the headphones change to a different noise cancelling intensity...but at every stop, your headphones think that you got off, so the automatic motion detection switches to ""walking mode""...imagine this on a 10-stop bus commute, and the number of times your headphones switch from commuting-walking-commuting-walking-commuting... Then imagine the occasional stop because of traffic lights, the occasional roadwork, traffic... For some reason these headphones seem to think that ""commuting"" means ""non-stop fast travel from start to end"". Having to constantly tweak the settings on my commutes when I just want to relax and enjoy music or podcast or even just silence is definitely not a good start to the day. 
- These headphones will occasionally turn off for no reason. Sometimes they restart, sometimes they just turn off without restarting, adding to the endless list of disruptions that you can expect to experience while using these headphones.
- It's great that you can easily control volume and playback by swiping on your earcups...so long as you don't rely on the option to connect two devices at a time -- a great feature, but one that often disables (for some odd reason) the ability to use gestures to control playback and volume. You'll never know when this happens, but I can assure you of this -- it *will* happen.
- There's the option to use ""Spotify Tap"", with two open slots, both for the same feature (which is very odd): you can just switch from one Spotify playlist to another Spotify playlist...which one are you switching to? No idea, it just switches it to a random playlist...and I have no idea why this was added as a ""feature"".
- Although Google Assistant is still advertised as a great feature for this pair...it's actually not available. Google have revoked this feature, and it's not even a new announcement, but for some reason Sony still advertises this as a selling point.
- No worries if you still want to use a voice assistant function -- there's Alexa...which works...so long as you keep the app open...but if you have the app open on your phone, you may as well just use your phone while you're at it -- which leads me nicely to my final point:
These headphones were not meant for you to listen to music or whatever form of entertainment you want to enjoy. These headphones were meant for you to use -- use the app to correct the frequent mistakes, constantly swipe across the earcups and press the buttons to fix the errors, regularly open the Sony app to tweak the settings of your noise cancellation, and hope that you won't have someone around you nudging you about how bad the sound is leaking from your headphones while the volume isn't even at 50%. These headphones are a huge step back for Sony -- sure, they packed a lot of innovation and great tech in it, but with the constant tinkering I've had to resort to these past few months, these headphones feel more like a really expensive gadget to with, and less like a pair of headphones."
These are hands down the best wireless headphones I have ever used. They make you feel completely immersed in what you are listening to. I love that they cancel noise but don't completely cancel everything so you can still be aware of your surroundings. They are super comfortable and don't squeeze my head at all. They were super easy to sync to my phone as well. I am absolutely obsessed with these head phones.
"I bought this a few months ago and I’m happy that I did. I bought it to use in conjunction with Elgato Wave XLR and Wave DX as part of my gaming set up #wildflame71. The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones connect to the Elgato products via the Twelve South Airfly Pro aptX compatible wireless transmitter/receiver and enable wireless sound via Bluetooth. This is successful and once you have the hang of it fairly straightforward. The cushions are memory foam and a good size - my husband has a pair too and is happy with the fit. Multipoint connectivity is a great feature and phone calls connect seamlessly whilst switching from my Twelve South Airfly Pro via the Sony Headphones App to my iPhone 15 Pro. The App walks you through setup of the headphones easily. Adaptive Sound Control, Speak to Chat and 30 hours of battery life make this headset an excellent choice whatever your activity."
Bought these a couple of days ago and so far everything is great.
"I really do have to say , my breath was tooken away! Absolutely amazing sound! The clarity with our gaming, phone calls etc. I really have to say I'm not sure it can get too much better.I highly recommend."
"My very best ever headphones! Best sound quality, exelent battery life, very light, comfortable fit and the best ANC performance"
I was very disappointed with the noise cancelling feature as it doesn't do a very good job of stopping background noise. I bought them based on other people's rave reviews for this feature but they are no better than others I have tried.
sound quality iasout of this world cannot fault this product in any way
It's the best noise cancelling headphones I have ever used they take it to a whole new level i couldn't even hear my lawnmower and the sound is so clear and smooth it sounds amazing I use to think that noise cancelling was just a gimmick but know I love it
"the left side headphone just went off without any warning or physical damage. I can hear external voices which is the main reason why i bought it, noise cancellation."
Poor keep pausing music all the time wouldn’t waste money
Love the product. App not intuitive and took me nearly 15 attempts to register the product online
I bought this a couple of months ago and I am very pleased with the quality of the sound and comfort of the headphones.
I tried to connect to two devices and it didn't work. I tried to speak to multiple reps. Could not resolve. So I returned the product.
"In terms of design, I love the looks and feel of the product. It is easy to carry around, even though it does not fold up. The carry case is really nice, and not too big which I was concerned about. 

As for the comfort, they are the most comfortable headphones I have used. Materials are nice enough, and wearing them for multiple hours is not an issue.

Sound quality is not the best, however it is really good. On top of that having the equalizer is an awesome feature, which allows you to fine tune the sound profile.

Other nice features are the active noise canceling, touch controls, long battery and fast charging.

Maybe the only thing that I don't like about these headphones is their ability to connect to only 2 devices, which in my opinion is kinda buggy. Using them on Windows is also a pain, since for some reason Windows does not detect their microphone. (This could be an issue with Windows or the headphones I'm not sure)"
"## Design
- No folding available in this iteration, just the usual cup tilt and pan. Works for me, don't mind the lack of foldability.
- I personally appreciate the new design and can describe it as far more sturdy and quality feel. No more plasticy sounds when adjusting the headphones or moving your head
- The cups are comfortable, with memory foam, coated with some kind of artificial leather
- The proximity sensor is no longer visible(compared to M4), but is still there
- Headband is comfortable and narrower. However, when at the gym and bench-pressing/dumbbell fly they still slide back off my head.
- Approx. 5gr lighter on the scales than previous models. I can't really tell the difference when wearing either model, so doesn't make a difference to me but appreciate the change.
Overall a welcome change. The cups seem a bit thicker in profile than previous iterations but overall with same comfort and nice fake leather coating material. Those are a fingerprint magnet(if you have the black headphones). Yet I prefer this design. The mics are quite visible though and given the grills are the trademark bronze/gold colour they stand out. Not really a fan of that color choice but given what it provides in other departments I have made my piece with it. Might not be for anyone. Definitely though would prefer the mics grills color to be same as the cups color.

## Active Noise Cancelling and mics
- 7 visible mics positioned strategically around the ear cup for noise cancelling and voice calls
- wind noise reduction is significantly improved (in NC mode only) - while listening and for the other side of a phone call
- voice calls recipients no longer complaint about muffled or unclear speech, difference is quite audible.
- Adaptive mode is very accurate in changing profiles both action and location based. Super useful in your everyday commute, gym, run/walk and in the office due to personalised ambient sound levels available through the app. You can save frequent locations with predefined ANC/ambient sound levels. Manually entered several of those and all worked well. But that is more on usability and the mobile app, yet worth mentioning.
Overall very happy with the improvement in noise cancelling, especially in windy conditions such as the one I encounter every day in my park walks. Gym feeling is the same top notch.

## Buttons, controls and inputs
- Same two button operation plus the same gesture controls as before: double tap, swipe up/down/left and right and tap and hold with palm
- Still no dedicated button for multipoint connection control. You can pair the headphones with two devices and switch between them but only through the app. I really believe a dedicated button provides far better user experience
- Same USB-C charging with fast charging available
- Same audio cable provided to connect to your device if you do not want to use wireless
- Same touch controls on the right cup, quite responsive and with nice sound feedback

## Connectivity
- BT 5.2 - I appreciate that every iteration is supporting the latest BT protocol
- Same frequency response as previous models in wired or wireless mode

## Features
- Supports most Digital assistants - Google/Alexa/Siri
- Connected apps option - chose what connected and supported app to run when double or triple clicking the NC button. I am using Spotify and when double click the NC button music starts playing from that app.
- Speak-to-chat feature where once you speak transparency mode is activated until your voice is no longer picked by the headphones mics(5/15/30s or auto timeout). No more sing along in this mode :)
- Battery life claimed is same as previous models - around 30h. I managed to get ~22h(100% down to 20%) with adaptive mode on and volume 30-50% . Quite a good deal. It could be different for you based on your prefered volume levels, EQ and NC mode. Worth noting that I received a firmware upgrade(1.1.1) right after the test.

## Sound
- Playing the same song with default EQ seem to give this new XM5 a clearer mid-range than previous iterations(XM3 and XM4). For the casual listener I doubt it would make any change. For me personally I always use the EQ to adjust mid-high frequencies and also crank up the Clear Bass to +7. You must hear it for yourself with your favourite track to be able to appreciate the difference.
- Quite a big technical change is the new drive - 30mm down from 40mm but with some better insulation and lighter mats such as carbon. Frequency response is same both wired and BT. All that signifies a change in the drive cavity and how bass resonates to produce the same quality low frequencies.
- Each and every one of us has slightly different sensitivity for different frequency bands and self preferences as well therefore a head to head comparison of the output over a microphone(with different frequency sensitivity bands and possibly remastered post recording) gives some perspective but is in no way a fair depiction of what you, yourself, might take out of those headphones(or any audio device for that matter) and classify as ""good"" or ""bad"".
Overall seem like an improvement(in the mid-range frequencies) and very much so appreciated. An audiofile will definitely hear a difference if comparing with predecessor. I still do and yet I am not a professional audio engineer.


Given everything I mentioned, if you had any previous WH1000X model, I can describe this new one as a good step forward. In any other case prepare to be blown away. Coming from the other two brands competing with Sony will still feel very different and an improvement in most aspects. A very welcome upgrade I'd say - noise cancellation, audio quality, connectivity(with the exception of multipoint management) are all top level. A must have for travel on the tube, going to the gym or for a walk in the park. Adaptive ANC is brilliant.
I very much want to see a hardware change for multipoint device management on the headphones themselves. Maybe a dedicated button to switch between connected/registered devices. Also, can't wait to see what Sony can offer in future iterations with regards to further improving noise cancelling, especially dynamic wind noise removal and would they offer multi-drive and true DD5.1(that would be amazing!) version of this product one day."
"The sound quality doesn't seem any different to the mark iv and I experienced fall out, bad sound, crackling and difficulties with pairing, mis-play stopping... Not impressed so far. But maybe this will improve after rain. Also, the redesign means the headphones no longer sit flat when you put them around your neck. Seems like an obvious thing to retain in the re-design."
"Value for money, very comfortable. Good NC. The auto NC feature is also useful."
"Decent quality sound. I’ve been using AirPods for a couple of years and have bought the new ones. 
These XM5 blow everything out of the water"
"Amazing just amazing nothing else , no other words just amazing"
I bought these after my other half kept stealing my WH-1000MX4 headphones.  These were great and I am delighted with the newer WH-1000MX5 model.  They are so light that you hardly notice that you are wearing them yet they are very secure when you are out and about even in blustery winds.  The sound quality and ease of use is simply right in every respect.
I love these they have such great sound. I love the app that you download and makes it so easy to use. The controls are so easy to use on the side of the head set.
Fantastic sound great features brilliant worn on plane does cancel all noise.
Researched multiple products and found Sony to out perform the rest.
Good headphones but Worst instructions I have ever encountered
"Bought these a few weeks ago. I’m very happy with them. Sound quality is brilliant. They are very comfortable to wear, and I can wear them for a few hours at a time. The noise cancelling on them is ridiculously good. Had a bose pair of noise cancelling headphones, but these are far superior. The one drawback would be the black colour, they are like a finger print magnet. It’s very easy to see dirt on them. Also a bit annoying they don’t fold"
Perfect headphones for listening in a world without background noise. Fit perfectly over ears for extreme comfort
"the headset it's self is amazing. the sound is wonderful, they are very comfortable and they look amazing all while having the best Active Noise Canceling around.
4/5 because of the app. the interface is not comfortable and more customizable widgets would be greatly appreciated"
"Sony have excelled once again improving from the previous WH-1000XM4 headphones which I didn't think was possible. These headphones are definitely more comfortable to wear for longer periods in part because the of the shape of the earcups, but more so because of the improved feel of the soft leather padding around the earcups. They also appear to provide much better soundproofing from exterior noise as they fit closer to the shape of your face, and that's without switching on Noise Cancelling which is excellent.
Putting the headphones onto your head is now so much easier with the sliding headband, no more clicky settings, they just fit first time and I found the band very comfortable, possibly more so than the 1000XM4's. As for the touch controls on the right earcup, I think sensitivity may have been improved as sliding my finger up and down or across the cup face worked first time every time.
Taking phone calls also worked very well, could hear my caller no problem and same for the person calling hearing me clearly. The voice pickup to temporarily pause music playing when talking to someone is nice to have as well and didn't let me down, can be activated/de-activated in the Sony app, your choice.
As for sound quality, they are superb and is probably somewhat dependant on quality of the music files played. If you can play Flac/Lossless files using LDAC audio then you will love them as Sony have clearly done work on improving all aspects of the sound stage. I have played Classical, Pop, Rock and Electronic music files and in my opinion the instrument separation from bass through middle to treble was much clearer, especially in the top range. Bass wasn't overbearing, but you can make it so from your sound source and it might overtake the mid to high notes, but everyone has their own preference, just saying you can boom the bass if you want it.
All in all I think Sony have a winner once again. If I was to find one thing I didn't like so much, it's the case. I know its a different setup to the folding 1000XM4's case which I really like, albeit you can't fold that down flatter like the one provided with the 1000XM5. A minor niggle that doesn't detract from a great pair of headphones."
"This is the first pair of headphones ive brought since i was a kid so with the power of youtube i viewed about 30 reviews and got honest opinions. Then i decided to take the leap and sony havent let me down , Great comfort , the noise cancelling is so great that while im playing my frank sinatra i cant hear my wife nag at me so thats an added bonus."
Don’t hesitate honestly… no fault  at all… super easy to set up…
Such a good buy glad to have picked them over a different brand
"There’s ins’t much to say that hasn’t already been said, so I’d simply like to say if you’ve read the reviews, seen the comparisons and have a change to buy these, do what I did and you wont regret it. Simply Awesome over-ear cans!"
"I bought these to replace a broken pair of Bose qc11. I thought the Bose were excellent and would be hard to beat, but I did a bit of research and the WH1000-XM5's were getting good reviews. I am so glad I got these as they make the Bose sound like a pair of beats studios!"
i recently got these headphones and i got to say these are comfortable and the sound is great and they cancel the noise and all you hear is the music and nothing else and it was easy setup to connect to my phone These are the best headphones i have ever owed keep up the great work sony
"Easy to use and very comfortable , brilliant technology in making these headphones"
been using for a week now and its better than the apple ones
"Sound is superb, noticeably better than the XM3 that I upgraded from. But the bluetooth connection is not so solid. I was thinking of returning them but turning off speak to chat helped considerably resulting in the drop happening occasionally instead of regularly. I also find the case awkward at times. If not for these issues they would be worth 5 stars."
"Having previously used sony headphones including the wh-xb700, I looked forward to trying out this model when it arrived. Day 1 and i got straight on to testing them out. The packaging being recyclable is great for those who want the latest tech, bit not to destroy the enviroment. The next bonus was the case. On my last headphone review I really wanted top brand headphones to have a case to keep them in top nick. Sony havent disappointed here with a solid case including a nice little part for the wires. 
The design: 
Lightweight but sturdy these headphones ooze quality. The buttons are easy to use and the phones look good to match the sound quality. They are cofortable to wear and suitable for use of a short journey or longer listening experience. 
Features:
These things come with so many features you will not be able to imagine them all. Top of my list is the ability to hover your hand over them to hear whats going on. Great for kids who just shout over the top. I love the swipe up etc for volume and next tune. Downloading the app lets you play further making these a great bit of tech. 
Sound:
Well this is the most important feature for a headphone and Sony havent let us down. Trying a plethora of music and movies over these and i couldnt find fault. Weather you be at home, out and about or on a busy bus the sound quality and noise reduction is top notch. 
Putting the headphones through a sound check even made me jump when testing the binaural sound check(getting up to answer the door to find it was just my headphones i had on). 

Top quality and great design,all in all these have really suprised me in how far headphones have come."
Nice sound. I like the noise cancelling. The sound could be a bit louder.
I had the XM2 then XM4 and now XM5 which is so complite much better !!!!!!!!!!!
Beautiful headphones. Aesthetically pleasing and beautiful in blue. Audio quality is superb and packed with brilliant features like Speak to Chat
"When these WH-1000XM5's arrived I was pleasantly surprised. I've seen many YouTube reviews and the headphones always looked big, but when I opened them up they were actually quite small, but in a good way. I've never been someone who likes bulky headphones and these XM5's snuggled on my head perfectly and the ear cups are just the right size. 

I have the Xperia 1v smartphone and the wireless connection was quick and simple and boy they weren't joking about being noise cancelling. When I put the XM5,'s on my head without any music, all noise around me was drowned out by about 89%. Once you press play on YouTube music or Spotify, the sound is crystal clear and the bass is pretty amazing too!  You can easily get lost in hours of music, whether you're on a train, on a plane, in a park or on a beach, the Sony WH-1000XM5's will last you a full day and will easily be one of your top go to tech companions. 

I am excited to see what Sony do with the next Gen Headphones."
These headphones are 100 percent worth it they are not heavy at all the noise canceling is so good I used my Alexa at max volume to tast the noise canceling and I couldn't hear anything around me and these headphones are worth it and u get a 4 month free Amazon music and etc....
Headphones are so light with amazing noise cancelling feature
"I would give 6/10 sound quality not that impressed good controls 
Too big for my normal sized head on min setting and have tk move head slip to avoid moving them
Battery life is good 
But expected more sound quality and lack of volume not good also"
"This is a truly excellent pair of headphones. The design is stylish yet understated and the build quality is very good as far as I can tell.  They sit extremely comfortably on my head and I will be using them in the office a lot.  

The sound quality is as good as you'd expect from a premium pair of headphones like these but what makes that so good is the noise cancelling.  You truly are in a world of your own when they're on.  Even the sound of human voices are substantially reduced, let alone the almost perfect reduction of white noises such as fans or road noise.

The ease of use features are also very welcome with instinctual swipe functionality on the right ear piece. It makes using them just that much better.  A stand-out feature is the ambient mode which can be triggered for as long as you hold your palm up to the right ear piece for quick situational awareness. Long ambient requirements can be instigated by a push of one of the two physical buttons on the left ear piece (to swap between noise cancelling and ambient mode)."
"These are absolutely amazing. I recently took them on a trip and first of all the noise cancelling made it so I could barely hear anything of the plane engine while I was flying. The sound quality is crystal clear, and all of the smart functions are very very cool. I also like this case a lot compared to older ones (I also have a pair of h.ear MDR-100ABN) because it is flatter and has a nice compartment for the wires. Overall, it feels like Sony has thought through every aspect of how to make an excellent headphone and executed it."
"I bought these to replace my momentum 4's and like the sound. I don't use a mobile phone often so it would be nice for a pc version of the Sony headphones app on here.
Build is nice, earcups are comfortable. I got a separate app for my pc that supports LDAC and I like the streaming movie equalisation. Thank you Sony."
"When connected to any devices apart Android (MacBook, iPad, Wimdows Laptop, iPhone), bluetooth is constantly and periodically breaking up on calls! Music is okay, but as soon as a call comes in, the microphone is switich on and off."
"I bought this a couple weeks ago and have been using it 3 days a week to travel into work (London). I've really enjoyed using them. The noise cancelling is great, I can always hear my music/audio clearly and any outside noises are extremely quiet or non existent. The ambient-mode is great for hearing the outside world more clearly without taking the headphones off, and you can still hear your music fine. I often use this feature for listening to announcements on the train or if somebody is talking to me. 

The only down side so far is the comfort. The ears are fine, but the headband gets slightly painful after about an hour of use. It could just be my headshape, and usually after I move it back or forward it will stop for a bit. I think it might be related to how narrow it is and the pressure it has, because I have other headphones with wide cushioned bands and they never get uncomfortable."
"Does not have the best noise cancelling which makes you want to increase the sound to really activate that side of noise cancellation, but however I did and ruptured my ears."
"Amazing sound quality, best I’ve ever heard. Love the touch sensitive right headphone to skip and Change volume without buttons, only thing is it comes in only 3 colours and design is a little off. But pretty sure it is a good deal for the money. Would do 4.5 stars if I could"
Great headphones offering excellent noise cancellation. Very comfortable to wear for long periods and easy to connect to Bluetooth sources. Highly recommended.
"Had all these over the years and these are the best.  Light, easy to use and synch with devices like iPhones.

Great sound and some great touch features."
"Long battery life with great sound quality using the auto equalizer (Beta) feature. They are comfortable to wear. However, Active Noise Cancelling is great but not the best, especially blocking high pitch voices it does not do a good job blocking that compared to the Airpods Pro 2nd Gen 2022 that does a much better job. Apart from that I would highly recommend."
"These headphones are great. Stylish and yet very functional. They don't come with a charger but I have plenty of usb-c cords. The headphones perform very well, they have multiple modes for what you need. I mainly use the noise canceling when listening to podcasts and it feels like people are sitting right next to you."
"Upgraded from the XM3's to these as they came free with my Xperia 1 V phone - and these are excellent! The sound is fantastic (although, I'd personally prefer more bass), the noise cancelling is excellent (especially on the noisy London Underground). Also, much much MUCH better when handling calls as now the other person can actually here me talk and not hear the wind constantly. The only downside (hence the 4 stars) is that they don't fold - which is rather annoying for storage purposes. Overall, excellent headphones!"
"I have had these now for four days. I wear them every day listening to all sorts of music.  And I mean all sorts!  From classical to rock , from rock to folk, to pop.  I have very eclectic taste. Using the SONY headphones app I can sort out the EQ status to suit the music.  The sound at all levels is excellent from the treble to the bass the distortion is non existent and when you listen in 360 reality the sound is even more amazing.

The comfort of the phones is really good.Indeed, I sometimes wonder if they are on my ears as they are light and do not compress as much as other headphones.  I like the fact that when I take them off the music stops.The headphones are almost like a glove - they just fit nicely to my head and ears without too much manipulation. And I have not needed to charge them since their arrival - amazing battery life.  The noise cancelling seems even better than the previous models and I sense the phones adapt as I move around to different locations; from my office to my lounge to my kitchen and outside.  The bluetooth connection is great- just finds my devices instantly.

But the sound is what makes it for me!  High quality. I use FLAC files for my music and you really appreciate listening on these headphones.

Lastly SONY has packaged using re-cyclable materials; a great step forward. And I like the carrying case - light and the headphones fit in well. All in all SONY has upped their game.  Possibly the best headphones you can get - until SONY bring out a newer model"
"I bought this 1 month ago. Absolutely amazing design, excellent sound."
"Really good noise cancellation feature, sometimes the voice activated pause doesn’t work or works then doesn’t play sound again even after it’s made the noise to replay. The sound quality is really good and it’s hard for others to listen to whatever you’re listening to. The sponge on one ear has collapsed on a side which is a pain. Overall quite comfortable for a few hours but can’t make too sudden movements as they fall forwards/backwards quite easily."
I was looking to buy a premium headset and after trying my purchase I am not disappointed at all. It sounds great and clear
Bought them to replace 1000xm4's that started whistling in my left ear. They are easier to pair and volume and ambient sound controls are improved.  Needed a set with good noise canceling.
"This is a really nice set of headphones! They feel really nice on my ears and the headband part is easily adjusted. Over time, the headband does start to get sore on my head and I have to adjust it, but this has been the case with all of my headphones. I have a smaller head and they aren’t tight enough on my ears to just stay put without the support of the headband. 
The sound is very nice, with surround sound so that both ears hear different sounds and background noises. The noise-canceling is very good also, although I haven’t had the opportunity to give them the ultimate test yet: airplane ride. They definitely cut out any noise around my house and in public. 
The charge lasts a very long time! I’ve used them a whole day without them dying.
The travel case is very nice and compact, with a little compartment for the cords. It came with a short charging cord and a wired stereo cord but no charging block, which seems to be standard now.
One of the really cool features is that it pauses when you lift one ear off your head. So if someone makes a quick comment where you need to hear but not fully remove them, just lift, listen and then put it back down on your ear without missing what you’re listening to (I do a lot of audio books).
Overall, I’m very happy with these; they’re definitely the best headphones I’ve had!"
"Ver easy to connect it, to controll it and on top of everything so good sound, with one word great product of Sony"
"Bought this a week ago, cannot say how impressed I am"
"The products ambient is excellent, the app is very useful, the headphones are comfortable and I can wear them for hours. My issue is the noise cancelling now its good as it should be but with certain songs that have a lower treble or bass the noise cancelling is pretty weak or even the actual song If it's quite low pitch yh the noise cancelling will be a lot less effective"
"Excellent noise cancellation, well balanced and excellent sound quality. Worth the price."
Everything about these are top quality but the adaptive sound control can be slightly annoying at times
"The Good: Sound quality, Active noise Cancelling, Call quality, Wind supression. 
All of these features have improved since previous iterations of this product range. 

The Bad: Design Functionality, Durability.
The new sleek design looks cool but you lose tha bility to fold the headphones away properly. Also my left earcup hinge has broken off from the headband after a year of use (I used them heavily to be fair, but I expected at least 2 years before encountering significant damage)."
"Overall these are pretty good headphones. I would have liked a bigger sound stage and occasionally the sound is a little muddy. I also have issue with “micro dropouts” when connected to my iPhone 13 which is infuriating. Although I would have liked more padding they are comfortable and the ANC is good. Support for spatial audio and Atmos would have been nice, rather the proprietary system than Sony uses and nobody on the plant supports"
Best present ever. changed my life. I put them on when the world is just too noisy. Ideally I would like adjust them to make the band slightly shorter but otherwise amazing!
These headphones simply put are amazing!!! The sound quality is like no other! For once I am able to make hands free calls and be heard!!!! I love the fact that if you remove them while listening the media pauses. They are very comfortable for wear for long periods of time.  The only draw back about them is that the charging cables is only a few inches long.
"These are headphones I never knew I needed, after just one day of using them they were so comfy that I really cannot go back to using my old pair. The noise cancelling is fantastic too, still trying to get used to which sound means it's turned on or off. Fantastic battery life and works incredibly wired as well!"
"Only used once so far but the noise reduction appears to be first class, also I love the operating functions control on the right earpiece. I think I'm going to love these based on my first impression"
"I've been using this product daily and it has been working great.
The passive sound insolation is great and the ANC works great.
The only issue I found was when I have two devices connected (mobile and laptop) sometimes the headphones don't make the playback switch between the devices but this easily fixed with a simple action on the app."
"These are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn.  They fit over your ears completely, leaving your ears pain free.  I also wear glasses and find I can wear these headphones without any pinching or discomfort.  The noise cancelling feature is unparalleled, truly drowning out the sound around you.  My favorite feature is that they automatically pause your music/podcast/show when you take them off, and resume when you put them back on."
"The sound is excellent. After getting use to the app, setting up the user experience was easy. 

I like using touch sensitive pad on ghe left earpiece."
"Great headphones, until the noise cancellation just no longer worked at all, I tried messing around with settings in the app with no success, would not recommend"
"I was thinking about buying the 4th version, but when the 5th version came out, I just bought them, and im really happy with them.
Nice build quality, best music quality, and best NC."
Just as good as my bowers and wilkins headphones... for a third of the price! I love them best noise cancelling ive experienced!
I bought the headphones a couple of weeks back and so far they have been excellent; they have all the features that I personally value - noise cancellation for example is excellent and the ambient mode is pretty good. The controls are intuitive when you get used to them and the app is somewhat helpful. My only recommendation is connectivity - I'm on IOS and miss the instant connectivity offered by ios proprietary products. Otherwise 5/5.
Superb performance but controls are poorly marked and therefor difficult to identify correctly. Operating instructions that accompanied the headphones are totally unreadable without a magnifying glass and therefor useless. Very disappointing.
"First set of over ear wireless noise cancelling headphones used and not disappointed. Excellent quality and functionality. Smooth set up and easy to use.  Good fit around ears with excellent sound, noise cancellation, stop/start and level of sound adjustment. Tested whilst hoovering, receiving phone call with TV on in the background and having a conversation with someone nearby. All worked really well."
I use this product as assistive technology to help my sensory sensitivities and auditory processing issues. It's excellent at this; the voice filter feature helps me to hear people in noisy environments and the new design of the M5 is much more comfortable to wear for long periods than the M4.
"Received the M5s as a package deal with my Xperia 1 V and whilst they have had limited use, when I have used them, they have been fantastic.

I got to be honest, I'm no audiophile and love my M3s and only upgraded due to the package deal and like the M5s.. A lot! 

I think I prefer that they don't fold, which does mean the case is a bit larger but let's be fair, you don't buy overheads to save space! 

I like the fact that instead of 'clicking' as you expand the headphones, they instead just glide.. Very satisfying!

But best of all (at least for me!) they're lighter than the M3s and fit over my PSVR2, making them my absolute go to for VR sessions and the lack of weight means they don't budge, which I was very happy with.. I know the weight seems negligible on paper but I really can feel the difference in VR. 

Haven't found any flaws but may be down to the fact they have had less than ten hours usage but saying that, my M3s are still going strong and have no doubt these will be as well, in a couple of years time..

Overall very happy with them and another quality Sony product added to my collection!"
"I bought these headphones to replace my 1000xm3s and xm5s are better in every way.

Build quality is excellent, sound quality is crystal clear with the right amount of bass, noise cancelling is the best I’ve heard and the case is really nice. I gave mine around 24 hours of burn in time to judge them properly. Call quality is also excellent on these. From my brief experience, the pause when speaking worked every time, however on one occasion it did activate when someone was talking in the background. 

The new ear cushions Sony has put on these make them one of the most comfortable headphones I have tried and they are firm enough that they don’t feel like they are about to fall off. 

Connecting to android or Sony Walkman gives the best experience as they support LDAC for much higher bit rates, you can immediately tell the difference when listening to high quality sources such as Amazon Music HD.

Overall I am very happy with these headphones and they have exceeded my expectations; I would not hesitate to recommend these to anyone looking for wireless bluetooth headphones.  

The headphones also came in plastic free packaging, nice touch Sony!"
I think it's one of the best Noise Cancelling  Headphones in the world.❤️
I bought the latest XM5 to use on flights so I could listen to music and drown out the engine hum. They did an excellent job cancelling the engine noise whilst giving an excellent sound quality to my music
Did lots of research and seems sensible to go in this direction - glad I did. Great headphones!
Labākās pasaulē iesaku visiem skaņa ir perfekta un apkārtni nedzird
I bought in nov 23 and since then I'm amazed how cool this headphone is
I bought these recently and was so happy i did as the sound quality is really good and the noise cancellation is second to none.
"I can not tolerate ear buds. I don’t know if my ear canals are just too small or what, but I prefer headphones like these. These are super comfy and great quality! The sound is impeccable and truly does cancel out noise around you!!"
The noise cancelling and transparency modes are great
The Best Noise Cancellation Headphones IOnThe Market
"Excellent quality, and easy to adjust in app settings; the only downfall is when someone rings, I have to turn the headphones on again as they always turn off."
"Hard to believe that Sony could improve on X4s, but they have managed it with the new X5s."
"These are great headphones. You have to download an app to use them but after that its smooth sailing. The headphones automatically connect to my phone when I put them on. They keep your ears warm too--- if not a bit too warm. When talking on the phone with them, they eliminate pretty much all background noise and provides a nice experience on phone calls for both callers. The noise cancelling is awesome. It's pretty active and reduces all background noises to almost nothing. You can put your hands up on the headphone and it allows sound to travel through when you need to hear momentarily. One issue I do have is working with the app and figuring out how to use the quick features on the headphones (answering calls, next song, etc). They come with a great case too that is durable for traveling with. Overall these things rock!"
just bought and returned crap headphones and poor sony comms.
I bought the WH-1000XM3 headphones 3 years ago as they were the best headphones around that price. The version 4 came out and they were slightly better but not worth the extra cost for an upgrade. The version 5 was an even bigger jump so definitely worth upgrading. I sold my 3’s for half price so the upgrade only cost 50% and well worth it.
Really happy with this purchase. Excellent quality and perfect for working from an open office.
"Amazing sound with these. Can’t fault them.
Features all work as expected and I find them very comfortable to wear.
Again, I find the sound with these is incredible. Clear and crisp and makes listening to digital music as if you are listening to traditional formats.
Amazing"
Look superb. Are very comfortable. Perform excellently with class leading ANC
My son gave me the headhones for my christmas and it is the best comfort headphons i have had for a while.
I got these as a replacement to my M4's which stopped charging.  And they are such a difference.  The M4's were great but these are really a step up in both quality of sound and the noise cancelling
"These are mine second Sony headset as I've broke previous one  (WH-910). Some updated features as changing track when you laying at the bed now you can disable at all to avoid accidental touch. Quality of sound is Sony quality, so don't even write about. Had a bit luck and was some good deal on Amazon, so I didn't hesitate and I'm happy about."
"First, my qualifications.  I am retired now, but was a professional player, arranger, and conductor.  I have listened to music through headphones and speakers all my life and am very conversant with what is needed to convey the quality of a performance. 

I listen to extremely dynamic music, both in range and power (which translates as volume on listening devices).  My taste ranges from Renaissance to Electronic music and from Jazz to Heavy Metal.  

I listen mainly to .wav (lossless) format files.  Therefore I need headphones to be able to convey the extremes of power with the same accuracy throughout the range; not to lose anything really soft, nor to be distorted at the other end of the spectrum.

QUALITY  As expected from Sony, the quality and presentation of these headphones is of the highest.  

They have their own case that also contains the headphone jack for direct listening and a USB-C cable for recharging.  

The matt finish does tend to show grease marks, but these are easily wiped away.

OPERATIONS.  They are intuitively easy to operate, just one button for on/off and one for Noise Cancelling/Ambient listening.  

Bluetooth connects immediately and there was no difficulty in getting any of my devices to recognise the headphones.  

I charged them as soon as they arrived and after about an hour's use they were down to 45% charge, but I expect that to improve as the batteries get up to operating standard.

PERFORMANCE.  I didn't research these headphones when they arrived, because I didn't want to be influenced by anything before I tried them. I could see that they were very well made, but I had no idea of the cost so didn't know what to expect regarding sound quality.  

Having tried the Ambient setting, I now exclusively use Noise Cancelling, which is remarkable and I have to rely on the dog to tell me whenever anyone is rapping on the front door, next to where I'm sitting. 

I could eulogise about how rich and sonorous the reproduction is from these headphones, but I don't really have the vocabulary that HiFi buffs have.  All I can say is that the sound is the best I've heard from headphones.  I don't think it's possible to exactly reproduce the aural experience of sitting in a concert hall with good acoustics, because of all the atmosphere that microphones can't garner, but these headphones are the next best thing.

So why only four stars? Because they become slightly uncomfortable after only a short time as my ears got hot.  I suppose it's part of the Noise Cancelling design, but, although bearable, it is a relief when I take them off.  Having said that, I listen to works lasting hours rather than minutes, so perhaps I'm not the typical user.

VERDICT.  Outstanding!"
"This is a great set of headphones, typical for Sony, in terms of construction and output sound quality. But the integral microphone does not live up to the description. Even when used in a quiet room, it does work as well as even an inexpensive boom microphone."
i bought it for xmas as a treat for myself and i can’t seems to put it down. i’m always using it with my iPhone 14 pro max
"they’re beautiful, very good sound quality, easy to charge, the only reason i’m rating 4 stars is because of the travel case. for £319 you only get a case with a small charger and an aux lead which many people won’t have use for because new apple phones/ipads don’t have an aux port. maybe by adding more quality chargers and accessories it would be 100% worth it"
Great looking and performing headphones. Sound quality is impressive and they are easy to use once you download the app to your phone. They look and feel high quality and have a good battery life as well.  If you are looking for a really nice set of noise canceling headphones I would recommend giving the Sony WH-1000XM5 a try.
The best headphone I bought for a long time . Great bass
I've only had my headphones for about 3 weeks now and I found them more comfortable to wear than  my previous earbuds and I was pleasantly surprised by how much better the sound quality was  I would definitely recommend them
"Vert good product, the sound is perfect, recommandés to every one"
"I bought this for my wife as a gift for our anniversary. She loves the platinum silver color. It’s lightweight and the sound quality is amazing. The mids and highs are great but i would prefer a little more bass. Maybe we can adjust it in EQ but that's an additional step. The noise cancellation and ambient noise are on point and i also live the gestures on these headphones, especially covering the headphones with your palm to hear someone properly which is very handy."
"Simple to use, great sound quality and class leading noise reduction, a little bit bland on the design front but appart from that - First Class"
I am just concerned on the ear cushions beeing a bit to soft.
"I ordered these as I work from home taking calls everyday and needed comfortable, noise cancelling headphones that have a good microphone. 

These tick all the boxes and are great, they’re light weight and I’ve had no complaints about the microphone quality. 
The sound quality is amazing, far superior than other brands I have had. 
I especially love the noise cancellation and ability to momentarily activate adaptive sound by holding your hand over the right headphone. 

Turning the volume up can be a bit of a pain as you have to individually swipe up each time rather than just holding it down to quickly change the volume. 

I just wish they came with spare covers for the headphones. Because of the matt finish they do tend to show the face oils that get on them so it would be nice to have the option to replace them easily but you can only seem to buy replacements form third party sellers. 

They do not bend so the carry case is quite large however I actually find this easier to transport than previous headphones as it’s slimmer meaning it slots into my bag easily however this may not be great if you have smaller bags."
I bought them to use at the gym. Really nice the noise cancelling.
Excellent product. works very well. very nice quality.
My wife and I purchased a set of WH-1000XM5 each on the advice of our son who has a pair of Bose and spoke highly of the noise cancellation function on flights. We tried the Bose and Sony headphones in a local store and preferred the Sony WH-1000XM5s. We have just returned after long haul flights to and from Maldives and the Sony headphones absolutely transformed our flights by closing out the aircraft noise and passengers. Despite the cost we would highly recommend the WH-1000XM5!!!
"This is my first pair of over the head style head phones and I’m shocked at home comfortable these are. There is slight padding at the top of the head and the ears are very nicely padded. The noise canceling is pretty impressive. To get the full ability to optimize you will have to download the app. Out of the box there is a setting that pauses your music if you start talking, the ability to turn this off is easy to do in the app. The only negative I can see is that because these headphones don’t fold the case is very large. They sound great and you can dial in whatever sound mix you want in the app."
"I am lobing my new Sony Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones. They came in great packaging, are easy t set up and use and the music quality is excellent. I love listening to music on and on and I also use it to watch movies on my laptop. I highly recommend it as a great buy!"
Super confortable and has the best noise cancelling
Excellent product. Noise cancelation is unparalleled
"OK, so I just got them, and only have about 2 hours of use so far, but the sound stage, and noise isolation on these are amazing.  Great headphones, I am not an Audiophile by any means, but I am very pleased."
"I was excited to start using Sony's WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones. I am currently typing this review while wearing the headphones!  First of all, the headphones are stored in a sleek carrying case.  There is a pocket for the headphone wired jack/cable and charger cable (very short cable?). Beautiful case, but bigger than previous model as this model's headphones do not fold up? Sound is AWESOME.  Noise cancelling feature is FANTASTIC.I cannot hear much outside noise when I have these headphones on.  Earpads are very very soft and comfortable. Hope the material on the earpads last after prolonged usage. Headband hurts a bit at the top of my head as it weighs down a bit, but that can be just me - I have a sensitive head.  Overall, a snug fit -- not too tight.  Learning curve was a bit tougher as I am older - but my son had the headphones up and running and playing around with its features in 15 seconds flat!!!!  Meanwhile,  I had to download Sony's headphone software onto my  iPhone. Do that as there are instructions in the app. Plus, you can set it up to link to Spotify, etc. and use the touch controls - for example, swiping up on the right headphone raises the volume, swiping down decreases volume, double tab pauses the music, forward swipe forwards to next song, taking off headphones shuts off power, etc.  These touch features are really snazzy when working correctly, but then I've experienced glitchiness as well. Lots of other features on the app  you can play with and customize to your liking.  I like the fast charging of battery and LONG battery life - big plus for me.  DEFINITELY WILL COME IN HANDY TO NOT ALWAYS BE WORRYING ABOUT CHARGING HEADPHONES! I foresee myself using this pair of headphones quite often!"
"I hate flying, had to take a plane for work. So I decided to splurge and get me a new pair of noise canceling headphones. After some research and hundreds or reviews read I end up with Sony’s and I couldn’t be happier. They knocked out all noise on the flight and I was able to make it to work no problem so happy with this product!"
I have only been using this headset a few weeks but already impressed. I travel to work on a bus and it's quite noisy. The noise cancelling shuts it all out as if I have the bus to myself. Sound quality is great for me.
"So many surprises come with these heads phone like how comfortable lightweight and how unnoticeable they feel on your head, easy to use functions I particularly like how all functions are on one side of the headphones  rather that both. A favourite one is when you take them off they automatically turn off then on when placed back on your head great feature Sony. The noise cancelling I found outside worked very well so many features and suprises but the best suprise was the sound clear crisp high tones mid and  base  which you can play about with to your own preference in the app which comes with them. These are a quality product from Sony which I  have now replaced my Technics AZ70W with."
These are awesome. They actually work unlike them other ones out there that don't work for nothing. Now I can sleep in peace without listening to my husband snore.
"Great quality 
Use the custom setting as you can then personalise it"
Upraded to these from my WH-1000XM3's. So much better with many improvements.
"I bought these to replace my three year old Bose QC 35's, whose battery was dying. They had served me well and I couldn't fault them.
When I received the Sony headphones, I was astonished by how much better they were than my previous pair. I took time setting them up via the Sony Connect app and now, I could fully appreciate them, the sound quality is superb, the lightness when wearing them was amazing. No other headphone in this price range even comes close."
"I had Bose QC35s for 6 years without a single issue. Within 30 minutes of using these I noticed a crackling in the right earcup. Whilst trying to establish the issue via the Sony Headphones app, the app itself starting crashing and then not allowing my headphones to connect. A few days later the headphones just started turning off and back on whilst using them. At this point I’ve given up and will likely return them. £350 for constant problems. First and last time I’ll be buying Sony headphones unfortunately."
Got the as a Christmas present using with a Samsung projector work flawless from the get go
"These are very good headphones, bought to replace some Sennheiser Noise cancelling ones that were non-Bluetooth. The sound quality of these Sony headphones is excellent and the noise cancelling system works very effectively. Only minor complaint is that the instructions are pretty non-existent - I felt as if I was just randomly trying out the various options available through the headphones app. Had some initial problems with the app not connecting to the headphones reliably - through trial and error I worked out that the headphones had to be switched on and connected to iPad/iPhone before the headphones app could be started up! On reflection might have been a bit of a doh moment? Anyway I would not hesitate to recommend these headphones - they have excellent sound quality and battery life looks to be lengthy"
"I've been through quite a few sets of headphones, both in-ear and over the head over the years. For using at home, for phone calls or music, these are by far the best. The controls are easy to use, they are comfortable and they have incredibly sound quality. They should for this price. The noise cancelling feature was the clincher, it is as good as everyone says it is, and saves me from so much stress in daily life."
"Had these Sony - WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones for a couple of weeks now , they work perfect the noise cancelling is brilliant when my wife natters away I can't hear a thing , I bought an blue tooth adapter so I could listen to my old non blue tooth hi-fi and turntable the head phones work great and connected immediately and my old records sound fantastic also these were the most comfortable out of the ones I tried in the shop they connect and work on my mobile phone as well really good sound.
Would recommend these to every one ."
"I already own a pair of Bose headphones, but these Sony headphones are awesome, they are comfortable, the sound is brilliant and the best part is the noise canceling ability, the other great quality with these headphones is that you can use them wireless or, as I purchased them for, to use on the airplane via the cable supplied, brilliant pair of headphones, plus the come in a handy carry case, I would recommend them to anyone."
The headphones sound great but they keep turning or disconnecting. It happens several times every time I use them and it seems to be getting worse
"I wear headphones everyday for my job , and for fun . I have been threw alot of headphones cheap to expensive,  and by far I love these. They are noise canceling,  easy to use, Bluetooth,  and the best part is if you move them off your ear, it automatically pauses your stuff. So no more having to stop and pause manually which helps especially for my job. I'm love they come with a really nice case, easy-to-use,  and carry anywhere.  You will love these . The quality alone is so good.  Just love them. They last forever before you charge them. The best I say for sure. Obsessed!!"
"It sounds great and the noise cancelling is the best on the market. Its not cheap but its well worth the price. The feedback sound could be quieter or optional but otherwise its perfect.
The case is really solid too and feel quality."
"The WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphones are awesome. I’m a satisfied costumer. These block out all the unwanted background noise, especially my fan. The battery life is amazing to. The fit is perfect and comfortable. Great for traveling with hours on top of hours of play and talk time. You can’t go wrong with this purchase."
Everything is perfect except the design (looks a bit cheap).
"Impressed by qualty of sound and ANC, construction and comfort"
The headphones are comfortable with robust frame. The noise cancellation which allows me to concentrate better in a noisy surroundings.
Unlike any previous headphones I've had fantastic quality. Perfect for travelling.
"Already had the XM4 ear buds which are great, but the noise cancellation on the XM5 is really good, as is the sound."
"I bought the XM5 on pre-order expecting great things. After wearing them for a week, I am back to my XM4 headset. The 4 has better sound quality and much better noise canceling. If I knew then what I know now, I would have waited for the 5 to come out and bought another 4 when the price dropped."
"I have been using BOSE headphones for about a decade now, but decided to try the Sony brand to switch things up and see what else was out there.  I bought the WH-1000XM5 headphones in March 2023. Within 2 months, the seam on the bridge of the headphones ripped right at the very end.  Now, the underlying cushion is pushing out, and as times goes buy the issue will only get worse.  I called Sony customer support to resolve the issue, but was told that it was a ""cosmetic"" issue and not covered by the warranty. I was not rough with the headphones, nor was there any trauma to the headphones, which I explained to the Sony representative. Now I am stuck with a ticking time bomb that currently looks unsightly, and eventually will rip the entire cushion off the bridge of the headphones.  I would certainly not recommend these headphones, and will likely never buy a Sony headphone again.  I payed over 400 dollars for these headphones, and Sony won't even own up to a design/production issue.  Looks like it is back to the BOSE all metal headphones.  I would post a picture, but the Sony website is not letting me."
"I am delighted with my headphones. I downloaded the app to my android mobile and connected immediately, no faffing about.  I especially like being able to talk with the mobile in pocket.  Noise cancelling is great, I have to wear hearing aides so over ear works very well, haven't tried it on a plane yet.  It can pair with a maximum of 9 other bluetooth devices so I also connected to my smart Sony Bravia TV through the TV settings menu. My older TV required a bluetooth adapter ( 1Mii Bluetooth 5.3 Transmitter Receiver for TV from Amazon - £23.99) which plugs into the sound jack and can also be used in a plane instead of the included cable.  I also got a TP-Link Nano USB Bluetooth 5.0 Adapter for Multiple Devices - £9.99 from  Amazon for my Windows 10 PC so I can now Skype/Zoom hands free.  The comprehensive on line manual to read in one go but very thorough.  Overall I think it is quite brilliant!"
"I bought this for a long haul flight and have been thoroughly impressed with how well it filters out noise, best I've tried so far. Battery lasts a long time and gesture control also works very smoothly."
"Coming from the XM3s I thought it would be a good update. The soundstage is epic compares to the 3s, the low end is more detailed and defined this time round. Mids and highs are present, not muddy. Call quality with the extra mics are amazing, also cancels background nice and wind. Also the new design is great, no creaking with this design. If you're coming from XM3s or earlier, or your in the market for a great sounding headphones IMHO just buy these along with the Sony app, they work amazingly well."
I received these as a Christmas gist to replace aged NC headphones from another manufacturer that were falling apart after many years use. First impressions are a massive upgrade in sound and comfort. NC works well and they have been easy to sync with all my devices.
"No doubt the headphones are great, I wouldn't know because even though I bought them a couple of weeks ago, I have had so many problems accessing the manual that it has really put me off using them.
Why can't you just supply a simple to use and understand manual for the basic functions?
Why isn't there any indication of a weblink inside the packet?
Why isn't the manual downloadable as a pdf so that it can be printed out?

Just simple solutions!!!

Yet instead, you make life so frustrating."
"I bought this few months ago and it's incredible in terms of features, NC and sound quality."
"Ear lobes started aching after an hours wear.
Mode switch appears to do less than the previous model."
Bought this for a Christmas present so have not tried but read reviews
Bought this yesterday great product very easy to use
"Can’t complain. Only bad thing about it is when I’m using my lawn mower it thinks someone is talking so it turns off the music, but the easy fix is to turn off the feature till im done."
"The Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones are absolutely outstanding. This is my first experience with noise canceling headphones and the sound is crystal clear and I have no annoying outside side. You literally don't hear anything else except for what's coming through the headphones.
Additionally, I am computer challenged and didn't have any troubles hooking up through bluetooth. It wasn't complicated and I was able to do it with little assistance!
Lastly, the comfort level is amazing. They feel great and I can wear them for hours. The charge also lasts for 30 hours and a 3 minute charge gives you 3 hours of time. How fantastic is that?!? I can't wait to take them on my next long plane ride."
"Hello All, This is first time I tried sony 1000XM5, I must say that this is best pair of noise cancelling headphones in the market. Noise cancelling is simply awesome. Sound quality is best. Wearing these headphones for long time doesn't cause any fatigue. I like Blue colour variant. Listening to my favourite EDM  music is absolutely a pleasure. Cheers."
"I used to have the 4th version of this headphones and bought the WH-1000xm5, but almost immediately I noticed a few minor things I don’t like. First of all, great set for the headphones, other than what I’ll mention, these headphones get me through my day with great noise canceling and sound quality. The fit well and are more comfort than the last version (xm4). Now, with that said, there are 2 problems that affect my work and use of these headphones around other people. 1) When I’m in close proximity of others having a conversation, the noise canceling doesn’t work up to 100%. When there is speech around me, the quality of the noise canceling turns to maybe 50-60% effectiveness and doesn’t actually cancel noise around me. It think I’m trying to listen to them, but I’m just trying to listen to my podcasts. 2) My headphones randomly turn off. I’ll be wearing them for maybe an hour or two Andy headphone just shut down. Not seeing a reason as to why. Not the biggest issue because it has only happened twice (not replicable). Other than those two issues, really solid pair of headphones!"
"Been using these for work as it doubles as a hands free kit.
The noise cancelling is good enough to block out the noises from a refrigerated trailer and most of the cab sounds.
Makes nights out a bit easier to sleep.

Haven't really used the voice activated features for skipping tracks as the touch functions on the right ear have been enough, even functioning well with gloves on.

Speak to pause playback is handy but given that it's two taps to pause and two taps to play again, it's not a feature I use.

These headphones come with a host of other features that are useful, using some of them and disabling others means you can personalise them to suit your needs.

Comes with a nice carry case that has a space for the charging cable as well as wired connection to a device. 

Battery has proven exceptional, 2 12 hour shifts with near continuous use on each day and still had 25% charge remaining. 

All in, a very good headset, feels and looks high quality with superb sound."
Bought these for holidays and I'm delighted with them. Sound quality is fantastic as is the noise cancelling. I would definitely recommend
I am very happy with these headphones. Wonderful sound.
I bought this a week ago and I can’t stop using it
Superb sound quality. Extremely comfortable even over extended listening periods. Easy functionality for controlling with touch sensitive ability. The Sony app on your mobile is extremely intuitive. A stunning listening experience on all counts.
"Since walkman when it comes to sound and TV I only trust Sony because it never disappointed me. This one is included. Superb sound quality and features, clear calls and music, I am glad I upgraded from WH-1000xm3. The only negatives (if you count them as negatives) I would like to use both side of the earcup surfaces equally for features. At the moment you can control your music on one side and assistant features are on the other side. as they are touch surface, I would expect them to make it possible to control using either side of the ear cups. Headphones app is great to control settings for your headphones but I expect an easier interface and better integration. Sometimes, even though my headphones are connected to my phone, the app stays stuck at ""trying to connect...."" message in the notification bar. the auto noise cancellation pressure is amazing. the noise cancellation is so good that you really cut out from outside world. the voice recognition and letting you have quick conversations is a great feature to have. occasionally it activates even though you don't speak but it happens rarely so I wouldn't mind. Ambient sound detection is great but I don't use it much because I love noise cancellation and pure quiet. The headband needs a bit more cushion support because if you use it long time, it may start to hurt your head. 360 sound upscale and spatial sound is amazing. I wish there were more albums released in this format to listen like you are in the studio. but they are limited at the moment. 

I would highly recommend this if you are looking for great sound quality and great features."
Bought the new xm5s a week ago. Sounds is awesome but for Me the earpads are way to soft and almost no padding. Inside material touches my ears and pushes to hard on them which causes discomfort almost immediately and after a few minutes have to take the headphones off. Very disappointed.  Sony doesn't listen to their customers.  Previous models which i own aswell same problem.
"After 18 months or normal use I went to wear the headphones yesterday and one of the sides simply snapped. 

I noticed there are hundreds of people saying the same thing on other forums and Youtube"
"I've had these headphones now for 3 weeks and I'm very happy with them sound is great, very comfortable to wear for a long time a great battery life and the moment I turn them on they connect straight away to my phone everytime"
Great sound . Use it on the train and tube. I hear every sample sound on a track or movie like i'm in the actual studio
The sound quality is excellent. Headphones are comfortable to wear and are simple and intuitive to operate (I am 59 and not a tec savvy youngster!). Well done Sony!
"I've purchased the cream version of the headset. I have used it on a very busy 10hrs flight and I am really happy with the quality of the ANC. The case is very well designed albeit the flap covering the cable storage box is a bit flimsy, I think it could have been done with a velcro pouch and a zip and it would have been easier to manage.
Bit disappointed with the bluetooth controls it could be easier to connect and it doesn't always re-connect. Could have used a bit more padding on the head as it becomes a bit uncomfortable after a few hours. The touch volume control takes a while to get used to, I am kind of missing the volume buttons."
"I love it, Great sound, the noise cancelling is not the best but it will do, but the quality across the PC, is great! I do have problems to conect with the blutooth on the PC all the time."
My husband loves his gift. Noise cancelling and crystal clear sound qualities are a bonus.  Best headphones he's ever had to date
"The noise cancelling is good and they are comfortable also good quality sound when making calls using bluetooth connection. But the controls are really confusing - only 2 buttons to do everything with, they arent very responsive, & the response is inconsistent. for example hold it down for 5 seconds & sometimes that will do something & sometimes it does nothing. And the sounds that indicate all the different states (on off connecting ANC on/off etc) the sounds that indicate each one are all very similar, which makes it infuriatingly confusing. I have another well known brand of ANC headphones which arent as good in terms of the ANC but i select them over these every time because there is a voice that says ""bluetooth off"" etc instead of a silly sound that sounds just like all the other sounds. I dont want to have to spend time studying my headphones in order to learn allthe sounds, i have better things to do with my time! If it werent for that would have given them 5 stars"
"This is one I can wear all day - the soft headphone cups are very comfortable and padded well enough.

The sound quality is excellent. For music, you really can hear the detail in songs. The base is super clean with no distortion and plenty of depth and the mids are clear and full, not the hollow scooped-out sound you get from other headphones. The highs are crystal clear without being tinny."
"I'm very happy with my latest Sony WH-1000XM5 ... the sound it's brilliant, very good quality product, very well made, I definitely recommend them."
"I got these WH-1000XM5 headphones last month and just want to say that I’m totally in love with them. The sound quality, looks and ease of use make them my essential bit of kit whether I’m out and about or indoors. They come in a protective case which flattens when you need to put it in your backpack and they’re so quick to charge and comfy to wear too, what’s not to love ❤️"
"These headphones are smart. Very smart indeed. Im not usually a fan one bit of over the ear headphones. But in all honesty these would have to be my favourite of what i have tried. From the sleek feel and style, light weight fast action amazing technology. I was so impressed from simply putting them on to taking them off. Easy to use functions with a very powerful battery life 30 hrs!. Bass is good and not distorted with very clear sounds. Very happy with my product. Carry case is pretty sturdy with compact headphone slot and cables.  Again as a person who's preference isn't usefully this type of earphone i was very very impressed. Im still amazed  by the sleek lightweight but yet powerful capabilitys of this product. You sure do feel lost at times wearing these .....amazing."
Wery good !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I've used Sony's 1000X models for the past 5 years. It seems they manage to tweak and improve them with every iteration, a bit here and a bit there. For my latest purchase I was unsure if the value of the Mark 5 model was that much better from the Mark 4, and for the most users perhaps Mark 4 would be better value for money. For me, the wind noise cancellation performance of the Mark 5 is far superior than the one on the Mark 4. The fast charging and dual connectivity are cherries on the cake. Design is slightly improved, headphones are still collapsible, though not folding in itself like all the previous models did. Still, if you plan on getting a pair of magnificent headphones with superb battery performance and unparalleled sound quality and noise cancellation performance (excluding 1000$+ headphones), you can't miss with the Mark 5 model!"
"Good headphones, a little on the large side though. I have a fairly small head and on their smallest setting they're a little too big for me. Not a problem around the house but I'm always concerned about going outside with them on, they could easily fall off."
"I bought these for in December and they broke after 4 months.  The band has a weak spot above the ear muffs and breaks apart.  I purchased the protection plus plan from Sony, which states that it covers accidents and manufacturers defects.  These broke easily and it will be hard to proved it wasn't an accident.   It appears to be a design flaw, so thank goodness I bought the Sony Protection Plus Plan"
I purchased a Sony product a few months ago and am happy with my device.
Upgraded from XM3’s and noticed the difference. Design is smaller and more comfortable and sound quality has improved even though it was excellent on the XM3’s. Worth the upgrade.
Very happy with WH-1000XM5 the quality of sound is super and noise cancelling is bar none the best.
"I recently suffered a minor hearing loss in one ear, and following from that I needed a pair of headphones that could:-
- deliver best in class noise cancelling to protect my hearing in noisy environments [specifically, on the Northern Line in London!]
- allow me to achieve the best quality music reproduction at the lowest possible levels again to protect my hearing but also to allow me to still pursue my lifelong love of music [using noise cancelling and providing high quality sound reproduction]
- progress work calls whilst on the go with maximum clarity / fidelity

These headphones have exceeded all of my expectations, and I can honestly say that every penny spent was more that worth it. Thank you, Sony."
FANTASTIC SOUND QUALITY. EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE FOR WEARING OVER LONG PERIODS. AMAZING SOUND CANCELLING
"I couldn't believe how cool and techy they are. They're so innovative with those cool features and commands. They're very easy to use, the sound is great!, and they're very comfortable."
"These are the most fantastic headphones I have ever had (and I have had many.) 360 Sound is spectacular, opening a whole new way of hearing music I have listened to for years in lower quality. The noise cancelling is outstanding and the phones are quite comfortable on the ear. Superb overall!"
The best and most comfortable headphones I ever had. Well done Sony.
"After many happy years using my entry-levet Sennheiser HD450s, this pair really takes listening to the next level. With an extremely versatile app, your music truly becomes personal. Highly recommended."
The WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones are great headphones! They work amazing
"Excellent all round. Sound quality wise, they're not a massive jump up in quality from the also excellent XM3's so would consider them better value all round. If you're less price sensitive then these win, for the slightly nicer build quality."
"Excellent sound quality. Only criticism, a little bulky."
I bought it few days ago I use everyday first when I hear it sounds  really good after using few days my left speaker is not working I don't what wrong with these headphones so I request to take an action to resolve this problem or else give me a new headphones
"I bought these headphones almost 2 weeks ago, and I must say that they sound muffled, like when someone holds their hand over their mouth while they are talking. 
However, and now I am getting to the part that explains the title, if you know a good or great EQ Setting, or are confident in your skills of EQing your headphones yourself, these headphones can sound fantastic.
I can only recommend buying them, if one of the two last cases applies to you.
Build quality and comfort is great, a bit plasticy, but great. ANC and functionality is awesome (touch controls and only two buttons), but another annoying factor for me is that you can’t put them around your neck with the cushions resting flat on your chest (or collarbone). I can somewhat do that actually, but not quite perfectly."
"Performance is off the charts, I love them. I’ve had Bose, I’ve had Beats, I’ve had Sennheiser, these have been the best yet. I love the touch functionality although it takes a little getting used to where I’ve had previous headphones that have less, more simple functionality.
The app takes a little getting used to as there is a lot to learn but it’s worth it if you give it some time.
I use them everywhere but the noise cancellation is next level which I notice the most at the gym. It drowns out all the music playing through the speakers and I get perfect crystal clear clarity of my own music."
Can't fault them. Excellent headphones. Great sound quality.
"Yes, this is one of the greatest headphones ever, but it's not that durable, as the earcups is dangling off. I would rather spend my money on the xm4. Don't buy this. Not a great product."
I’ve recently bought these headphones and I’m very pleased with the quality and the fantastic audio
"Comfortable, great noise cancelling. A little disappointed with sound quality out the box but does improve after a little time & tweaking the EQ"
I have had the headphones for a few weeks now. The sound quality is exceptional and they are comfortable to wear. The transparent mode is very effective. What I really miss is the ability to mute and unmute the microphone from the headset so that while I am in a conference call I do not need to be by the computer to do that.
"The sound quality is good and even better when connected via the standard 3.5mm jack. Bluetooth music has some crackle and pop at times and it can be flakey and disappointing. Thankfully, I mostly use headphones connected by wire so that is not so bad but considering the price of these things, the quality is rather poor.
Noise cancellation should be significantly better than it is. While it does reduce the background noise considerably, all the hype I have been reading lead me to expect a bigger reduction. I still hear folks talking and traffic noise etc., and if I were on a train or airplane, these would not cancel out very much at all.
I was really hoping to be able to leave a 5 star review but these are a sad disappointment."
"Bought these headphones a few weeks ago and they were fantastic! Noise-cancelling was superb, I literally could not hear any outside noise (unless I wanted to). The touch panel was a bit sensitive, but it’s not too bad. All in all the features were superb."
"In bought this for in flight use and they are lovely. Good crisp sound, nice definition and power on the base.  Very good automatic NC.  During a 6 hour flight very comfy.  Overall very happy though pairing was a bit slow the first time."
"I bought this in July, and for the first 3 months it worked fine and lovely
However, then it started acting up, with the touch pad constantly registering interactions, stopping, starting and skipping tracks and making the entire experience unbearable"
Good noise cancelling headphones. It is an industry leading Headphone
Since the software update the headphones keep pausing. Your update is rubbish
"Pros
-Headphones feel higher quality.  It is still made of plastic but the smooth matte finish and feel generally seems higher quality than other headphones that I have in this price range such as the Jabra evolve 2 75.
- Setup was really easy using the ""HeadPhones"" app on android. 
- Ability to wear headphones while lying on bed.  One of the things that I'm unable to do with other headphones is being able to lie back on my bed without the headphones bothering me. These Sony headphones have a angle in such a way that they do not get in the way.
- ANC is very good. I have a 1 year old and have the white noise machine on all the time.  The ANC works really well at muting ambient sounds on. The ability to choose how much ambient noise comes through is also great. 
- Some nice quality of life features such as speak to cancel ANC, and also cutting the right ear.
- The memory foam around the ear really helps with comforts. Putting on for hours does not hurt.
- Sound quality is very good.
- Battery life does not drain quickly.  Leaving a fully charged headphone around for 2 days, I still saw 99% battery life after starting to use it again.

 Cons
- Microphone quality is poor compared to Jabra which have a boom mic that comes out. Speaking on the phone, my spouse thinks it not as good quality as speaking directly into phone but better than being on speaker phone.
- Not waterproof or sweat resistant. This means that they cannot be used outside while raining or during exercising.
- A full charge can take a couple of hours. There really should be quicker ways to charge this given the current climate with fast charging phones."
Best purchase I’ve made this year… Can’t wait to see what they would do with an XM6 if they make one
"purchased 2 weeks ago - best for me - soft, strong, good sound, nice mic"
Had these for over a year and am still more than happy with them. Very comfortable to wear and brilliant at cancelling out surrounding noises.
"Sound quality is exceptional and unmatched. Both of headphones and of speaker -people on the other end can always hear me incredibly well.
The hard case is incredibly bulky and inconvenient - would do better with a soft case and then I wouldn't have to just put them in my backpack bare. Some of the leather has started to pull away on the head band. App is very annoying - constantly updating and popping up PLUS it keeps automatically switching on a feature called speak-to-chat no matter how often I turn it off."
"Best wireless headphones Iv owned, app is really easy to use and sounds great straight out the box. Comfortable for long use as well"
"Bought to replace a pair of Bose quiet comfort headphones and so far so good. 
The app was a new thing for me (others were plug and use) and wasn’t immediately intuitive. My partner had the MX -4 so was able to help. Initial thoughts are good, very comfortable and sound is really clear . Ability to link to 2 pieces of tech is good, I think. 
Real test will be on my flight to Japan at the weekend. Hopefully they are easy to use on the plane!"
The sound quality of these headphones is awesome. However I was disappointed with the build quantity and size. I wish the top part of the headband was made of plastic while the bottom leather. I felt the headphones protrude a little too much and looked too big for my head. Would be great if Sony can get that great sound in a smaller form factor.
"These are an amazing pair of bluetooth headphones. When listening to music, the sound is rich and the bass is deep. They fit snugly over your head and not too tightly over the ears. The most outstanding feature I would say is the noise cancellation. For work I am often on conference calls. These headphones do a great job of getting rid of the ambient noise and focusing on just my voice. Definitely recommend!"
Bought these a few weeks ago and the quality and features are great
"I bought this product a month ago and I'm very satisfied! The audio quality is on par with audiophile brands, but the noise cancelling and the sleek design give it an edge in my personal opinion. Very comfortable on the ears as well."
I have wanted a pair of good wireless noise cancelling headphones for a while now. Did loads of research and was surprised by how all the reviews for the XM5 were nothing except superlative. Surely they couldn’t be that good?! They are that good. Forget all the numerous clever features - the sound is just incredible. I couldn’t be happier!
"The XM5s are just awesome! Sound, comfort, battery, build and noise cancelling is all top notch! Definitely one of if not the best headphones you can buy on the market in 2023! Highly recommend this product"
"After receiving the headphones I could pair them to my Pixel 8 Pro but couldn't register them in the Sony Headphones app. After trying it with another phone, it worked, so I concluded it was an issue with the Pixel 8 Pro. After contacting support they finally responded that Googles flagship phone was not supported and they wouldn't be able help, so now I'm stuck with headphones that I have to pair to another phone if I want to adjust setting until Sony updates the App to fix the issue."
"The noise canceling on these is absolutely amazing. I live in a house with a lot of noise, and these headphones give me such a feeling of peace. I can’t hear the fan, window A/C, air purifier, and all the other similar noises with these on. That’s without music playing. The audio quality is out of this world and I don’t believe I’ll ever be able to listen to music any other way ever again."
First off it came very well package these are really unique and comfortable headphones say it is noise canceling which you’re being able to listen to your music even better use for Apple iPhone and iPod it’s really great it’s very well put together these would make awesome gifts for birthdays holidays and Christmas is even great for teenage kids or she is off to college it would be really awesome it has a very good value as well and it’s really awesome for an older adults case which is really awesome it’s 1000 and come see him on a little pouch or bag rather so you don’t have to worry about losing them you can always keeping them clean the ear phones are very very countable it even has the chargers with it that you can charge it it has the power button it has the volume button which is really awesome you can even hook it to your computer and listen to music or listen to stories or whatever you need to listen to a good part about it you can put it over your head and you can move the headphones that goes over the ears moves back-and-forth which is really awesome and great it has its own little place did you put it back in and not have to worry about it being broke or being set on and it even has the adapters and everything also inside of it which is amazing these make great gifts for young adults for school for for holidays for anyone that really likes to listen to music even the older generation less listen to music and this will be really awesome specially if you want to listen to something and not worry about other people talking over you and you can’t hear your music discounts is that out so you don’t hear their noise which is really awesome is very good quality is a great value it was well put together and they are by Sony and Sony is a very good product I recommend this to all family and friends this is really amazing another thing this is amazing they even give you a free trial a 360 reality auto which is really amazing it comes with its own little book it says you had to connect to iPhone audio and different things that you need to connect to which is really awesome this is a really amazing product I recommend this to everyone this is really awesome The performance is really awesome the product is really great design it’s really really awesome I recommend this to our family and friends and the value is outstanding in the build of the product it’s even more amazing
"The noise cancelling on these is phenomenal and with some careful equalisation they sound very good. There are a few cons though, so I’ll list them. 
1. If your ears stick out a bit, as mine do, they’ll get irritated somewhat, due to the shallow ear cups.
2. The plinky plonk sounds you get when using the touch controls is quite annoying (for me anyway) and there doesn’t seem to be any way of turning them off, so if you’re listening Sony - please do something about that.
Those are my main complaints, otherwise they’re great."
"I recently had to start regularly flying for my job. So as to make the flights as bearable as possible I decided on a good pair of noise cancelling headphones. Having reviewed multiple models and makes on various websites I opted for these Sony WH-1000XM5’s. I made a good choice. They are simple to set up, connect to my iPhone very easily and the quality is unquestionable."
I bought these headphones a little while ago and I've used them every day since! They are truly amazing!
"I've had these a few weeks and I must say I'm loving the XM5. They are so comfortable I wear them all day working from home without discomfort. And they work well connected to both my laptop and phone. 
Calls are great and no complaints about call quality from colleagues. 
The transparency mode is acceptable. I can hear my surroundings. I don't use noise cancelling that much.
Sound is good but not better than my XM4s. And I miss the foldability of XM4s. 
So far no sweaty ears."
These are such a great product. the sound that they produce is amazing. They cancel out all the other noise to where you just hear your music or show.
"This is a very good product, will definitely recommend. No problem so far. Enjoying it so far"
"I received the Sony - WH - 1000xm5 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones and they are amazing. The sound quality is far beyond anything I have ever heard,  absolutely the best!! I love that they are noise cancelling and wireless. They also came in a really nice zipper case to put them in after using them. I am so very happy with the Sony Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones. I will definitely tell friends and family how great these Headphones are."
"I bought these specifically to use with a meditation programme that uses binaural beats, and they capture very low sounds.  And they do that brilliantly.  The bluetooth function is extremely over-sensitive.  Touch the ‘ear muffs’ by mistake and you’re in trouble!  They jump, turn it off and do other unwelcome things.  The instruction leaflet is so small I can’t read it.  And the app has been written for those who are fluent in computer-speak.  I do need these headphones for my programme, so usually use them connected to my ipad with the connecting wire."
