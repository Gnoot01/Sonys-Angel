Dorian W.,Verified,https://www.amazon.com/null,Reviewed in Australia on June 26 2023,"Likes - sound quality is amazing, noise cancellation is unreal. Battery life is fantastic - charging about once a month or less.

Dislikes - really not comfortable for long journeys - caused significant ear pain on (admittedly too long!) journey from Melbourne to London. Perfect for medium journeys though, 7 hours or so was fine. Great on the plane for reducing background noise"

Amazon Customer,Verified,https://www.amazon.com/null,Reviewed in Australia on July 31 2022,"Hateful product. Apparently they turn themselves off when they can't detect your head. Seems they suddenly decided after two weeks that I don't have one, so they turn themselves off every 30 seconds or so. I got so angry I tried to clamp them to my head and broke both flimsy arms on the horrid things and $500 bucks down the drain! Save yourself the pain and find a less ""clever"" pair of headphones. In these times where many of us use headphones for work, what idiot decided this was a good feature?"

The xm5s don’t have a feature to optimize noise cancelling based on environment so I winds up being ineffective in cancelling out noise 80% or the time. However I will say if you only care about sound quality then there is a noticeable upgrade in quality from previous gens. IMO I would say steer away from these if you are looking for good noise cancelling

The medicine Highs are crisp the base is punchy but not overly distorted. The battery seems to last quite a long time. The only thing that I didn't like is a fact that if your battery dies and you have to put it on the charger the USB does not seem to work anymore. You have to hardwire them to your device.

I wear headphones all night and I love the light weight and generous padding, not to mention the 30-hour battery life. I also appreciate how much more comfortable they are than the Bose Ultras or 45s, which I also tried. I also appreciate that I can disable any type of auto-off or sleep features on these Sony cans, unlike the Bose Ultras that have a sleep mode that I cannot disable.

The touch controls on the headphones also work well. The only downside is you cannot easily fold them up for travel."

I only had these headphones for less than two years and suddenly the right ear cup died completely, no sound or noise cancellation. I took great care of these headphones, only wearing them at home and expected them to last a lot longer than this. I've had tons of other headphones that have started falling apart long before the sound stopped working, so this is shocking and disappointing. With a warranty of only 1-year, I can't even get them replaceed. I contacted Sony but they don't want to do anything about it. Watch out for this product."
Zen,3.0,https://www.amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/R1AFI492PB673E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BXYCS74H,Reviewed in the United States on February 24 2024,"I purchased these headphones as I was going to be on flights for about 50+ hours round trip. Two of the flights were 16 hours long each and I had hoped that these headphones will provide the noise cancellation so I can sleep. After reading so many reviews, I was hopeful that they will cancel out almost all of the noise on a plane. However, I found that this was not the case. I was able to hear almost everything like crying babies and people talking loudly, it muffled the sound, but it was still loud enough for me not to be able to sleep. They did drown out most of the plane ambient sound like engine noise. When I used them with earplugs in my ears, they helped cut out most of the sound. So that’s what I did for the plane journey where there were three crying babies around me.

If I listen to music with these headphones on, then they definitely cut out more sound than when I just run the noise cancellation. I had downloaded the app and tried to adjust the settings on that for better performance, but did not notice a big change. I don’t like using earbuds like AirPods, but I find that these are barely any better than my AirPods 2. They are very comfortable though, and I prefer them over the bulky AirPods Max. The sound is also pretty decent, but my main purpose was noise cancellation and it was a bit of letdown.

The battery life is truly phenomenal and lasted my journey of 25+ hours, with just one charge. They get sweaty only after multiple hours of usage, but better than anything else I have owned, these are the only headphones I was able to wear for 6 to 7 hours straight.

I will carry them on any longer plane journey because they are better than anything else I own currently, but for this price I had hoped for even better noise cancellation."

Tyronne,Verified,https://www.amazon.com/null,Reviewed in Australia on March 15 2023,"Sony’s again leaning on a one-two punch of both LDAC codec and DSEE Extreme support here to offer the best possible sound quality from your connected devices. LDAC is your hi-resolution audio option, compressing and decompressing tracks on the fly to deliver much greater wireless bandwidth than a standard Bluetooth connection could conjure. But even if you’re on a lowly standard-resolution streaming service over Bluetooth, DSEE Extreme ekes out a little more detail by using AI upscaling techniques to restore some of the audio data which would otherwise be lost. Both do a great job."

But there are a lot of cons to them as well: bluetooth does not auto connect well and I have to constantly reconnect my devises, volume do not sync well or even at all with some devises and can suddenly jump to dangerously high levels without notice, which can cause hearing damage, and the ear cups are very shallow and get hot quickly.

That adds up to a lot of flaws for one of the most expensive headphones on the market. I tried these next to the Bose 700 and like the Bose better overall. They don't nearly have as many features, but they stay connected to multiple devises without any hassle, the sound is superior and the volume is consistent."

And that was it. The headband loop broke at a very inconvenient place: right where the ear muff rotates. And now that it did, I can see why: yes the retractable parts are made of metal, but the metal ends exactly at the rotation ring, and at this point, it is hollow flimsy plastic!!!
And when you call Sony to ask for warranty, they say ""Sorry, breakage is not covered under warranty!"".
Then you go to Reddit r/sony, and there are a whole pile of people there with broken Sony WH-1000MX5, exactly like mine.
Shame on you Sony, you designed great noise cancelling and comfortable ear cushions, but you couldn't design a sturdy headphone, and then you pretend you don't know about the breakability problem?
I also own a Bose NC700 for like 3-4 years now which I have dropped a hundred times, and from very high up on a ladder doing construction work, and they have never broken! Also they still look brand new!
Whereas the Sony WH-1000MX5, the ""skin"" on the outer shell of the earmuffs: It wears off and peels very easily, just from normal use, and very quickly they look old."

I previously had the first generation of Sony noise cancellation headphones (Sony WH-1000XM1) and it still works great. I upgraded to this one (Sony WH-1000XM5) and it was a worthy decision. While others might negatively comment on Sony's design change (not foldable) I am perfectly fine with it. I heavily use these headphones at work for meetings and calls and in other places such as coffee shops or during travels in airplanes. I heavily recommend these headphones.
Amazon Customer,3.0,https://www.amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/RMR8RSITTWN5H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XS7JWHH,Reviewed in the United States on February 21 2024,"I bought this headset to replace a pair of Bose QC 35 ii I had previously used at work, as the bluetooth kept failing and the sound was starting to have issues.

I've owned the Sony headphones now since the end of Nov 2023, which feels like a decent enough time to give a well informed body of the product.

Pros: Excellent noise cancellation. The location based customization is fun, but ultimately when I'm wearing these I'm at work and pretty much just need as much noise cancelled out as possible to avoid distractions. The music quality is also nice, though my main concern for headphones was to be able to focus in a noisy office setting.

Cons: This headphone has issues working with teams video calls and zoom. I've looked through tutorials and troubleshooting to fix the settings, but I'm having to fix the settings before EACH call to make it work. I would suggest either getting a separate headset for those video calls, or consider another option for headphones. This was never an issue I experienced with the Bose.

The headphone case it came in is nice, but I had problems with the zipper immediately. It's been incredibly frustrating having to struggle with a faulty zipper just to get my headphones out so I can start my day. I've already had to undo part of the seam to reset the zipper twice, and will likely just replace the case or attach some velcro to keep the case closed. I have a hybrid work schedule, so having a semi hard case to protect the headphones matters to me.

In sum, if your main concern is noise cancellation and you have infrequent video calls, I would strongly recommend this product. Otherwise, there are likely better options on the market."

Sony is really good at maintaining the application tied to the headphone user and the fact that I've recieved a number of helpful updates since buying these headphones has been great. I use these everyday for casual gaming, studying, and going to the gym. I recommend being cautious when using these when you're sweating a lot at the gym due to the sensors having an affect on sweat. I've noticed that the detection system build into the headphones doesn't necessarily work anymore due to how often I've sweated while wearing these headphones. One annoyance that I have is the ""Speak to Chat Feature"" which keeps turning on whenever I talk at the gym. It might just be my headphones in particular but even if I go into the app and manually select to turn this feature off, it some how keeps coming back and turns itself on again. This is frustrating when you're in the middle of a set while exercising and then all of asudden the headphones pause the music and ambient mode is turned on. Regardless, amazing headphones and I'd recommend them for anyone. I was hesitant to buy these initially due to everyone stating they do not hold up well in the gym but they still function well enough for my liking!

In the second photo I posted, you can see the slight stain marks caused by usage in the gym. If you want to avoid this, getting the black colored headphones might be recommended. However, I have been able to clean these stains out with a cleaning wipe. Plus, these headphones don't leave finger prints on the headphones which I know first hand that the black ones do (which was annoying hence why I got the white ones)."

The included case is a bonus. Makes them far less prone to damage when travelling."

It has great sound, good noise cancellation and amazing battery life.
The downsides:
Extremely expensive (the performance does not justify the price).
Noise cancellation: if you take the headset off for a seconds, the noise cancellation functions goes away... crazy setting! you need to switch off and on again. Very annoying.
Volume control: Sony decided to play Star Wars and removed the volume at all! same with any other switch that previous headset had... so now you only have a power-on switch, that it is! and to pair and control the volume I have the following word for you: GOOD LUCK!
The volume works with sliding you finger up or down. If you want to pause to tap twice. But hold on there, that you need to tap in the right spot, otherwise does not work (you might find yourself tapping your headset while walking, and it is hard to aim for the same spot!). The same with volume up and down. For some design reasons, the volume works in phases, so if you want to lower fully, you cannot, you are only able to lower bit by bit, repeating the action several times to get to the right volume. It is ridiculous. Takes a hell of a time and keep you busy with the device instead of enjoying your music/sound.
The issue is very similar than the smart watches that has digital (virtual) control over functions, instead of having a wheel that you can operate with your fingers any time, including while wearing gloves. If you have your hand wet or you are on the move, it is basically impossible to operate the device. The mechanical wheel is the answer. The same with this headset: why the hell Sony removed the volume and pairing buttons? I wont buy the next generation of headset if they carry on this way.
The device (headset) has been thought in a engineering environment, by engineers, not users. So it works precisely as the engineers defined, under the perfect conditions BUT life of the user is different. Try to volume up while entering a plane and having to carry your hand suitcase: impossible. Try to pair quickly with your rental car while on the go: impossible. The Sony headsets are a good piece of engineering but has huge challenges. My advise is to buy something alternative and not to spent so huge amount of money for a product that aim to re-invent the headset. Previous Sony headset did the job, was so hard to just improve on the comfort, the battery life and noise cancellation without the need of removing all switches in this new model? Avoid this model or learn to spend more time to try to control it than enjoying your music !"

The xm5s don’t have a feature to optimize noise cancelling based on environment so I winds up being ineffective in cancelling out noise 80% or the time. However I will say if you only care about sound quality then there is a noticeable upgrade in quality from previous gens. IMO I would say steer away from these if you are looking for good noise cancelling

I recently started a new job in a busy office building. I have very sensitive hearing, which means that I get distracted SO easily. I can’t focus at all whenever there is noise around me. So, I decided it was time to invest in some high quality comfortable headphones.

I wear these headphones for about 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Believe me when I say that I have never once felt uncomfortable while wearing these. The material is soft and lightweight—perfect for all day use. The controls are intuitive, too. My favorite feature of the headphones is that they turn into a microphone whenever I’m talking to someone, which means that I don’t have to take off my headphones every time I want to have a conversation. I can also quickly let noise in (like an announcement from my manager) by placing my palm over my right ear. This has come in handy many times!

The battery life is incredible, as is the sound quality. The noise cancellation technology is insanely good. I am seriously impressed by all of the amazing technology that is featured within these headphones. Thank you to Sony for saving my sanity at work!!!"

Any amount of fiddling with the equalizer doesn't fix the problem - just produces different flavours of muddy.
If you want crystal clear sound, just go with Bose.

Edit: After a whole weekend of fiddling with the equalizer settings, both using the Sony Headphone app and additional tweaking on the Equalizer settings on the Spotify app, I've got it to sound pretty good.

After spending some time with them, I must say that these headphones truly live up to the hype in terms of audio quality, comfort, and advanced functionalities.

The sound quality is exceptional, delivering crisp highs, rich mids, and deep bass that make every listening experience immersive and enjoyable. The noise-canceling feature works wonders, effectively blocking out unwanted external sounds and allowing me to focus solely on my music or calls. Additionally, the hands-free calling feature ensures that conversations are clear and uninterrupted, even in noisy environments.

However, my overall positive experience with these headphones was marred by an issue that arose upon receiving them. Despite purchasing them as new from Amazon, it became evident that the headphones had been previously paired with other devices. This resulted in setup complications with the 360 surround services and raised concerns about the authenticity of the product and Amazon's quality control processes.
It was disappointing to encounter such a setback with what should have been a brand-new product. I would advise potential buyers to exercise caution when purchasing these headphones from Amazon to ensure they receive a genuinely new and unopened product."

The band is tight. I cannot imagine wearing these throughout a 4+ hour airplane flight.
But that's part of the extremely effective noise reduction.
The app's server connection was unreliable for me, and the login process far to ""secure"" with difficult capcha matches, and after each failure, one's password must be re-entered. But you don't need the app for excellent function.
Positives:
- Outstanding microphone noise cancellation. This is active all the time, whether or not ANC is on for listening.
Speaking over to phone from a coffee shop (ceiling music, arguing staff, dishes clanking, a family conversation and squalling baby 15 feet away), the listener could hear little or no background noise.
It is very, very hard to get any information on actual performance on noise-canceling mics in buds or headphones. I finally found soundboys-dot-com, who way down near the bottom of their reviews have actual recordings in standardized noisy environments.
I've slowly migrated, over 6 years, through three units:
First, an ANC open-ear headset with a boom mic that I assumed would work well because close to my mouth. My wife casually observed that I spoke very loudly when dictating, especially. I wrongly thought this because we don't hear our own voice well when our ears are covered.
Then I forgot these on the train, and bought Beats for convenience -- the band and magnetic latches in the buds make loss difficult. These surprised me by having MUCH better mic performance -- never needed to raise my voice in a quiet environment for good speech recognition.
But in noisy environments (riding in a car or airplane. sitting an an airport waiting area, cafe, etc.), they failed. With dictation, I had to cup my hand over my mouth and the mic to avoid unseemly shouting, and then quickly hold the mic in my hand to suppress the noise during my silences.
It's interesting to me that voice recognition works better with ANC off, because then I hear my own speech volume more accurately and can modulate that realistically. Yes, one does need to speak louder in a very noisy environment, or simply talk into one's hand to reflect the sound back to the mics when one wants to be private.
These Sony headphones are exactly what I need.
For me, the excellent music quality is simply the frosting on the cake.
- One can plug in a standard mini stereo plug and the phones just work.. (There are stereo to USB adapters readily available.)"

---------------------

Since writing this body I have been contacted by Sony and they have agreed that it was a manufacturing issue and have offered to replace the Headphones with a brand new pair.

======================

The sound quality is awesome, I cannot fault a thing. Noise cancellation is very effective. Flying with these headphones is the best experience ever. You can enjoy a movie as if watching in your living room without any noise.

I paid around $430 for these headphones 5 months ago. One day they just fell apart. One of the earpads detached from the headband during normal use. It looks it it was attached with glue and glue did not hold anymore. A picture of the damage is attached.

I contacted Sony and they refused to accept it as a quality issue. They term it as accidental damage and maintain that it is not cover under warranty. They just gave me the phone number of their contractor in Salt Lake City (I live in LA). Other than providing the phone number they could not help at all. They did not want to even listen to my argument that it was not an accidental damage but one of the joints (held with glue) just came off, so it was a manufacturing issue.

The contractor told me to ship the headphones to them at my own expense and they would charge me $90.00 just to tell me how much it would cost to repair, and then they would ship it back to me at my own expense.

I have decided to write off the loss and buy Apple Air Pods Pro. Top-notch customer service is guaranteed with Apple products, and you have Apple Stores to go to if you have an issue."

It has great sound, good noise cancellation and amazing battery life.
The downsides:
Extremely expensive (the performance does not justify the price).
Noise cancellation: if you take the headset off for a seconds, the noise cancellation functions goes away... crazy setting! you need to switch off and on again. Very annoying.
Volume control: Sony decided to play Star Wars and removed the volume at all! same with any other switch that previous headset had... so now you only have a power-on switch, that it is! and to pair and control the volume I have the following word for you: GOOD LUCK!
The volume works with sliding you finger up or down. If you want to pause to tap twice. But hold on there, that you need to tap in the right spot, otherwise does not work (you might find yourself tapping your headset while walking, and it is hard to aim for the same spot!). The same with volume up and down. For some design reasons, the volume works in phases, so if you want to lower fully, you cannot, you are only able to lower bit by bit, repeating the action several times to get to the right volume. It is ridiculous. Takes a hell of a time and keep you busy with the device instead of enjoying your music/sound.
The issue is very similar than the smart watches that has digital (virtual) control over functions, instead of having a wheel that you can operate with your fingers any time, including while wearing gloves. If you have your hand wet or you are on the move, it is basically impossible to operate the device. The mechanical wheel is the answer. The same with this headset: why the hell Sony removed the volume and pairing buttons? I wont buy the next generation of headset if they carry on this way.
The device (headset) has been thought in a engineering environment, by engineers, not users. So it works precisely as the engineers defined, under the perfect conditions BUT life of the user is different. Try to volume up while entering a plane and having to carry your hand suitcase: impossible. Try to pair quickly with your rental car while on the go: impossible. The Sony headsets are a good piece of engineering but has huge challenges. My advise is to buy something alternative and not to spent so huge amount of money for a product that aim to re-invent the headset. Previous Sony headset did the job, was so hard to just improve on the comfort, the battery life and noise cancellation without the need of removing all switches in this new model? Avoid this model or learn to spend more time to try to control it than enjoying your music !"

Amazon Customer,Verified,https://www.amazon.com/null,Reviewed in Australia on December 3 2023,"Nearly $500 for ANC that is probably little better than my M3's. Devastated. I'm actually devastated. I could at least read when cricket (and only cricket) was on TV nearby they were enough to make it tolerable. These I've got no chance hence no use case for that outrageous price bracket. I was hoping for an improvement to make my life better as am disabled and stuck at mercy of carers/blaring TV. I updated software, I turned off Ambient, removed it as a button option, did all the troubleshooting they recommended. 99.5% sound blocking is coming from just having new/decent pads. UPDATE: other user correct, there's an issue with right ear, poor Sony. Poor. I put my hand over the right ear to turn off ANC (prior I'd been using the actual button) and that kicked ANC into better gear when I took hand away. Shouldn't have to do that. Also, personally I don't think it was worth the upgrade price at least for me given I'm used to decent already w/the W3's and that price point is agony for a pensioner."

Two of the flights were 16 hours long each and I had hoped that these headphones will provide the noise cancellation so I can sleep. After reading so many reviews, I was hopeful that they will cancel out almost all of the noise on a plane. However, I found that this was not the case. I was able to hear almost everything like crying babies and people talking loudly, it muffled the sound, but it was still loud enough for me not to be able to sleep. They did drown out most of the plane ambient sound like engine noise. When I used them with earplugs in my ears, they helped cut out most of the sound. So that’s what I did for the plane journey where there were three crying babies around me.

If I listen to music with these headphones on, then they definitely cut out more sound than when I just run the noise cancellation. I had downloaded the app and tried to adjust the settings on that for better performance, but did not notice a big change. I don’t like using earbuds like AirPods, but I find that these are barely any better than my AirPods 2. They are very comfortable though, and I prefer them over the bulky AirPods Max. The sound is also pretty decent, but my main purpose was noise cancellation and it was a bit of letdown.

The battery life is truly phenomenal and lasted my journey of 25+ hours, with just one charge. They get sweaty only after multiple hours of usage, but better than anything else I have owned, these are the only headphones I was able to wear for 6 to 7 hours straight.

I will carry them on any longer plane journey because they are better than anything else I own currently, but for this price I had hoped for even better noise cancellation."

Read a ton of reviews and decided to go for it. Out of the box, they sounded ok, but really came alive after messing around with EQ - using the Sony Connect app and/or a 3rd party EQ I've had for years. Very comfortable phones. Good sound imaging , great separation. Bass is punchy and tight after EQ changes; mids are fine and top end is pretty crisp and clear. There is a world of difference in sound between using my S22 Ultra and MacBook. Mac sound is pretty muddy and lacks presence. Using LiveOne on the S22 is 500% better; very clean and clear sonic attack. The Sony app is fine; lots (maybe too many) things to look at and think about. The thing I really don't like is how they feel when I handle them - very plastically - and honestly - kind of cheap feeling. Ear cup cover material seems low grade and a bit thin. And those ear cups - yucky feeling plastic. I would expect a better build quality (more solid feeling materials). Maybe the decision to go with plastic was a cost of design issue, in order tokeepp the price down and remain competitive. However, a product which sounds as good as these deserve better materials. Not sure if I'll keep them - need a few more days to make that decision. Bottom line: you gotta be your own judge, decide what trade offs you are willing to make to get the features you want and the that matter most. Also bought Boweres and Wilkins PX7 2Se. Will body them after trials.

Update: I will be returning the Sony headphones. Although my comment about the plastic earcups still applies, I believe they would hold up as long as one was careful with them. Maybe the feel of the product is not important to you, but design and appearance count for me. Again the sound and features of the Sony is great."

Sony is really good at maintaining the application tied to the headphone user and the fact that I've recieved a number of helpful updates since buying these headphones has been great. I use these everyday for casual gaming, studying, and going to the gym. I recommend being cautious when using these when you're sweating a lot at the gym due to the sensors having an affect on sweat. I've noticed that the detection system build into the headphones doesn't necessarily work anymore due to how often I've sweated while wearing these headphones. One annoyance that I have is the ""Speak to Chat Feature"" which keeps turning on whenever I talk at the gym. It might just be my headphones in particular but even if I go into the app and manually select to turn this feature off, it some how keeps coming back and turns itself on again. This is frustrating when you're in the middle of a set while exercising and then all of asudden the headphones pause the music and ambient mode is turned on. Regardless, amazing headphones and I'd recommend them for anyone. I was hesitant to buy these initially due to everyone stating they do not hold up well in the gym but they still function well enough for my liking!

In the second photo I posted, you can see the slight stain marks caused by usage in the gym. If you want to avoid this, getting the black colored headphones might be recommended. However, I have been able to clean these stains out with a cleaning wipe. Plus, these headphones don't leave finger prints on the headphones which I know first hand that the black ones do (which was annoying hence why I got the white ones)."

The band is tight. I cannot imagine wearing these throughout a 4+ hour airplane flight.
But that's part of the extremely effective noise reduction.
The app's server connection was unreliable for me, and the login process far to ""secure"" with difficult capcha matches, and after each failure, one's password must be re-entered. But you don't need the app for excellent function.
Positives:
- Outstanding microphone noise cancellation. This is active all the time, whether or not ANC is on for listening.
Speaking over to phone from a coffee shop (ceiling music, arguing staff, dishes clanking, a family conversation and squalling baby 15 feet away), the listener could hear little or no background noise.
It is very, very hard to get any information on actual performance on noise-canceling mics in buds or headphones. I finally found soundboys-dot-com, who way down near the bottom of their reviews have actual recordings in standardized noisy environments.
I've slowly migrated, over 6 years, through three units:
First, an ANC open-ear headset with a boom mic that I assumed would work well because close to my mouth. My wife casually observed that I spoke very loudly when dictating, especially. I wrongly thought this because we don't hear our own voice well when our ears are covered.
Then I forgot these on the train, and bought Beats for convenience -- the band and magnetic latches in the buds make loss difficult. These surprised me by having MUCH better mic performance -- never needed to raise my voice in a quiet environment for good speech recognition.
But in noisy environments (riding in a car or airplane. sitting an an airport waiting area, cafe, etc.), they failed. With dictation, I had to cup my hand over my mouth and the mic to avoid unseemly shouting, and then quickly hold the mic in my hand to suppress the noise during my silences.
It's interesting to me that voice recognition works better with ANC off, because then I hear my own speech volume more accurately and can modulate that realistically. Yes, one does need to speak louder in a very noisy environment, or simply talk into one's hand to reflect the sound back to the mics when one wants to be private.
These Sony headphones are exactly what I need.
For me, the excellent music quality is simply the frosting on the cake.
- One can plug in a standard mini stereo plug and the phones just work.. (There are stereo to USB adapters readily available.)"

These have all been present from the start. Maybe 20% of the time the headphones won't automatically pair to my phone or laptop. When they do pair, it takes a couple long seconds to start playing sound. If I walk out of bluetooth range the the sound will stop, and although my devices still show the headphones as connected there's no way to resume playing sound. All the smart features are a usability mess and I turned them off immediately. I want to like these but I can't anymore."

I've owned the Sony headphones now since the end of Nov 2023, which feels like a decent enough time to give a well informed body of the product.

Pros: Excellent noise cancellation. The location based customization is fun, but ultimately when I'm wearing these I'm at work and pretty much just need as much noise cancelled out as possible to avoid distractions. The music quality is also nice, though my main concern for headphones was to be able to focus in a noisy office setting.

Cons: This headphone has issues working with teams video calls and zoom. I've looked through tutorials and troubleshooting to fix the settings, but I'm having to fix the settings before EACH call to make it work. I would suggest either getting a separate headset for those video calls, or consider another option for headphones. This was never an issue I experienced with the Bose.

The headphone case it came in is nice, but I had problems with the zipper immediately. It's been incredibly frustrating having to struggle with a faulty zipper just to get my headphones out so I can start my day. I've already had to undo part of the seam to reset the zipper twice, and will likely just replace the case or attach some velcro to keep the case closed. I have a hybrid work schedule, so having a semi hard case to protect the headphones matters to me.

In sum, if your main concern is noise cancellation and you have infrequent video calls, I would strongly recommend this product. Otherwise, there are likely better options on the market."

"""dkdv""",Verified,https://www.amazon.com/null,Reviewed in Australia on February 10 2024,"I have to agree with the reviews of these phones. The music sound quality is really excellent, perhaps slightly better than my Bose Quietcomfort II. I have no problem either with the noise cancellation, although the Bose allowed you to do it on a scale of 1-10.

However they are really not as comfortable. They grip the head very firmly, giving me a bit of a headache when I've been using them for a while. Trying to wear them wearing glasses was impossible. The arms of my glasses physically hurt my ears.

Trying to register the product on the Sony website was a nightmare. They kept wanting me to ""voluntarily opt-in"" to having Sony spam me. And then the process kept failing. I eventually had to ring them, and had to speak to somebody who barely spoke understandable English.

Overall, if somebody was considering buying these or the Bose, I'd go with the Bose every time."

The replacement came in around December and by February, I have a non-stop skipping noise going on in the background of whatever I am listening to.

These are not worth the price for the quality. The noise cancelling is not much better than a pair of 45 dollar headphones. If I do not want to hear other people with the noise canceling on, then I have to practically blast sound from these. The round design of the headphones also hurts the top of my head, they are usually flat on top for a reason it seems.

I had been so excited to get a pair of quality headphones that would cancel out all of the loud sounds in my house but instead I wasted money on an inferior product that does not last more than two months at best. I always carry them in the case they come in and have done nothing that would damage the quality or performance of the headphones. To say I am disappointed would be an understatement."

These sounds a LITTLE better, not that much. Not enough to make up for the XM2's better headband, better ear cup material, better ANC functions, & WAY better ruggedness.

I have honestly abused my XM2s & even after 7 years of every day wear they are solid.
Just now, in 2024 is the ear cup material beginning to crack a bit but that's after countless hours/ days/ weeks of wear doing everything from relaxing, to gaming, to working out, doing yard work, felling trees, playing sports.
Tons of drops, sometimes poor storage, taking hits from footballs, sweat, rain, etc.
The XM2s are awesome.

Within 1 month, I could tell the XM5s just wouldn't cut it.
They easily slip off your head when you're active.
The ANC function is annoying & didn't seem to keep as much sound out.
Sony straight up warns you that ""these cannot get wet. Avoid sweat""
You can't sweat in these bro!?! What?!
Just terrible.

I'm gonna try a different brand until Sony makes some major changes with the XM line.
Good luck everyone. 🍻"

I upgraded to the new XM5s to let a friend buy my XM4s. Sound quality seems about the same - still the best on the market that I've heard personally. However, I think the headphones themselves feel a little more fragile. The case also seems less sturdy, though it may just be a more efficient design. The only real complaint I have is the touch panel. It's very sensitive to hair, etc., and actually is triggered by simply moving my head or often nothing at all. It was really frustrated if it started clicking next and skipping through a queue of songs, so I turned off the touch controls entirely. I don't use them too much anyway and haven't missed them. BUT! Even though the touch control does not do anything now, it will still make the noise as if you are skipping a song. If only there were an update to stop that noise when the touch controls are off, I would be content with this workaround. PLEASE Sony, if you read this, just turn the touch noise off! I'm upset that $400 headphones have such a simple but significant design flaw which you can scour the internet to find discussions of, but as long as these headphones continue to offer superior sound quality, I would absolutely forgive and forget so long as I can turn the touch panel click off someday soon!"

These sounds a LITTLE better, not that much. Not enough to make up for the XM2's better headband, better ear cup material, better ANC functions, & WAY better ruggedness.

I have honestly abused my XM2s & even after 7 years of every day wear they are solid.
Just now, in 2024 is the ear cup material beginning to crack a bit but that's after countless hours/ days/ weeks of wear doing everything from relaxing, to gaming, to working out, doing yard work, felling trees, playing sports.
Tons of drops, sometimes poor storage, taking hits from footballs, sweat, rain, etc.
The XM2s are awesome.

Within 1 month, I could tell the XM5s just wouldn't cut it.
They easily slip off your head when you're active.
The ANC function is annoying & didn't seem to keep as much sound out.
Sony straight up warns you that ""these cannot get wet. Avoid sweat""
You can't sweat in these bro!?! What?!
Just terrible.

I'm gonna try a different brand until Sony makes some major changes with the XM line.
Good luck everyone. 🍻"

I recently started a new job in a busy office building. I have very sensitive hearing, which means that I get distracted SO easily. I can’t focus at all whenever there is noise around me. So, I decided it was time to invest in some high quality comfortable headphones.

I wear these headphones for about 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Believe me when I say that I have never once felt uncomfortable while wearing these. The material is soft and lightweight—perfect for all day use. The controls are intuitive, too. My favorite feature of the headphones is that they turn into a microphone whenever I’m talking to someone, which means that I don’t have to take off my headphones every time I want to have a conversation. I can also quickly let noise in (like an announcement from my manager) by placing my palm over my right ear. This has come in handy many times!

The battery life is incredible, as is the sound quality. The noise cancellation technology is insanely good. I am seriously impressed by all of the amazing technology that is featured within these headphones. Thank you to Sony for saving my sanity at work!!!"

I upgraded to the new XM5s to let a friend buy my XM4s. Sound quality seems about the same - still the best on the market that I've heard personally. However, I think the headphones themselves feel a little more fragile. The case also seems less sturdy, though it may just be a more efficient design. The only real complaint I have is the touch panel. It's very sensitive to hair, etc., and actually is triggered by simply moving my head or often nothing at all. It was really frustrated if it started clicking next and skipping through a queue of songs, so I turned off the touch controls entirely. I don't use them too much anyway and haven't missed them. BUT! Even though the touch control does not do anything now, it will still make the noise as if you are skipping a song. If only there were an update to stop that noise when the touch controls are off, I would be content with this workaround. PLEASE Sony, if you read this, just turn the touch noise off! I'm upset that $400 headphones have such a simple but significant design flaw which you can scour the internet to find discussions of, but as long as these headphones continue to offer superior sound quality, I would absolutely forgive and forget so long as I can turn the touch panel click off someday soon!"

These are not worth the price for the quality. The noise cancelling is not much better than a pair of 45 dollar headphones. If I do not want to hear other people with the noise canceling on, then I have to practically blast sound from these. The round design of the headphones also hurts the top of my head, they are usually flat on top for a reason it seems.

I had been so excited to get a pair of quality headphones that would cancel out all of the loud sounds in my house but instead I wasted money on an inferior product that does not last more than two months at best.

The sound quality is exceptional, delivering crisp highs, rich mids, and deep bass that make every listening experience immersive and enjoyable. The noise-canceling feature works wonders, effectively blocking out unwanted external sounds and allowing me to focus solely on my music or calls. Additionally, the hands-free calling feature ensures that conversations are clear and uninterrupted, even in noisy environments.

However, my overall positive experience with these headphones was marred by an issue that arose upon receiving them. Despite purchasing them as new from Amazon, it became evident that the headphones had been previously paired with other devices. This resulted in setup complications with the 360 surround services and raised concerns about the authenticity of the product and Amazon's quality control processes.
It was disappointing to encounter such a setback with what should have been a brand-new product. I would advise potential buyers to exercise caution when purchasing these headphones from Amazon to ensure they receive a genuinely new and unopened product."

Since writing this body I have been contacted by Sony and they have agreed that it was a manufacturing issue and have offered to replace the Headphones with a brand new pair.

======================

The sound quality is awesome, I cannot fault a thing. Noise cancellation is very effective. Flying with these headphones is the best experience ever. You can enjoy a movie as if watching in your living room without any noise.

I paid around $430 for these headphones 5 months ago. One day they just fell apart. One of the earpads detached from the headband during normal use. It looks it it was attached with glue and glue did not hold anymore. A picture of the damage is attached.

I contacted Sony and they refused to accept it as a quality issue. They term it as accidental damage and maintain that it is not cover under warranty. They just gave me the phone number of their contractor in Salt Lake City (I live in LA). Other than providing the phone number they could not help at all. They did not want to even listen to my argument that it was not an accidental damage but one of the joints (held with glue) just came off, so it was a manufacturing issue.

The contractor told me to ship the headphones to them at my own expense and they would charge me $90.00 just to tell me how much it would cost to repair, and then they would ship it back to me at my own expense.

I have decided to write off the loss and buy Apple Air Pods Pro. Top-notch customer service is guaranteed with Apple products, and you have Apple Stores to go to if you have an issue."

After I received these headphones, I switched from Spotify to Amazon Music Unlimited, with ultra HD quality, and it's like I am hearing all my favorite music for the first time. The noise cancelling is mind-blowing. Definitely exceeded my expectations."

arabella,Verified,https://www.amazon.com/null,Reviewed in Australia on November 17 2022,"Did a lot of research on the best noise cancelling headphones and settled on these. Could not be happier with this purchase! They are so comfortable to wear, the noise cancelling is excellent, and the sound quality is great too. My partner has a Bose set and tried mine for a day and is buying himself these too."

Let me start with the love part – these are hands down my favorite headphones of all time. The sound quality is impeccable, offering rich, immersive audio that enhances every listening experience. From deep bass to crisp highs, they deliver an audio performance that never fails to impress.

However, there's a glaring issue that has left me feeling disappointed – the hinges. I've gone through two different pairs of these headphones, and both times the hinges have proven to be their Achilles' heel. Despite being meticulous with their care, the frail plastic hinges simply couldn't withstand even the slightest pressure.

After the hinges on my second pair gave in, I resorted to using gorilla glue in an attempt to salvage them. Unfortunately, this makeshift repair didn't last long, as they broke again, exacerbating the damage. Determined not to give up, I purchased an aftermarket hinge to perform my own repair. Yet, even with careful handling, one of the connector pieces snapped during the installation process, rendering the headphones unusable.

Given the premium price tag of these headphones, it's disheartening to see such fragility in a crucial component. If you decide to invest in these headphones, I urge you to handle them with extreme care and always store them in the case when not in use. Until Sony addresses this design flaw, I can't fully endorse these otherwise outstanding headphones."

The medicine Highs are crisp the base is punchy but not overly distorted. The battery seems to last quite a long time. The only thing that I didn't like is a fact that if your battery dies and you have to put it on the charger the USB does not seem to work anymore. You have to hardwire them to your device.

But there are a lot of cons to them as well: bluetooth does not auto connect well and I have to constantly reconnect my devises, volume do not sync well or even at all with some devises and can suddenly jump to dangerously high levels without notice, which can cause hearing damage, and the ear cups are very shallow and get hot quickly.

That adds up to a lot of flaws for one of the most expensive headphones on the market. I tried these next to the Bose 700 and like the Bose better overall. They don't nearly have as many features, but they stay connected to multiple devises without any hassle, the sound is superior and the volume is consistent."

I only had these headphones for less than two years and suddenly the right ear cup died completely, no sound or noise cancellation. I took great care of these headphones, only wearing them at home and expected them to last a lot longer than this. I've had tons of other headphones that have started falling apart long before the sound stopped working, so this is shocking and disappointing. With a warranty of only 1-year, I can't even get them replaceed. I contacted Sony but they don't want to do anything about it. Watch out for this product."

The noise cancellation could be slightly better, but nothing is perfect. Down the road, I also worry a bit about the matte rubberized coating coming off like it tends to do on plastic products over time, but for now, these are great.

The included case is a bonus. Makes them far less prone to damage when travelling."
