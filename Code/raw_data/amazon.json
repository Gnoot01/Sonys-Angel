And it can eliminate almost all the noise from outside, that can make me enjoy the music completely.\nBut the material collects the fingerprint just as efficient as my black Macbook, if you in favor of this guy, make sure you have time to clean it once a day."

I have no problem either with the noise cancellation, although the Bose allowed you to do it on a scale of 1-10.\n\nHowever they are really not as comfortable. They grip the head very firmly, giving me a bit of a headache when I've been using them for a while. Trying to wear them wearing glasses was impossible. The arms of my glasses physically hurt my ears.\n\nTrying to register the product on the Sony website was a nightmare. They kept wanting me to \"voluntarily opt-in\" to having Sony spam me. And then the process kept failing. I eventually had to ring them, and had to speak to somebody who barely spoke understandable English.\n\nOverall, if somebody was considering buying these or the Bose, I'd go with the Bose every time."

I could at least read when cricket (and only cricket) was on TV nearby they were enough to make it tolerable. These I've got no chance hence no use case for that outrageous price bracket. I was hoping for an improvement to make my life better as am disabled and stuck at mercy of carers/blaring TV. I updated software, I turned off Ambient, removed it as a button option, did all the troubleshooting they recommended. 99.5% sound blocking is coming from just having new/decent pads. UPDATE: other user correct, there's an issue with right ear, poor Sony. Poor. I put my hand over the right ear to turn off ANC (prior I'd been using the actual button) and that kicked ANC into better gear when I took hand away. Shouldn't have to do that. Also, personally I don't think it was worth the upgrade price at least for me given I'm used to decent already w/the W3's and that price point is agony for a pensioner."

LDAC is your hi-resolution audio option, compressing and decompressing tracks on the fly to deliver much greater wireless bandwidth than a standard Bluetooth connection could conjure. But even if you’re on a lowly standard-resolution streaming service over Bluetooth, DSEE Extreme ekes out a little more detail by using AI upscaling techniques to restore some of the audio data which would otherwise be lost.

I also use the headphones at home to listen to books and occasionally music. I have considerable high-frequency hearing loss so I can't comment on the finer details of audio qualities. For me, the audio quality is excellent. Also, my only other experience with headphones are all from Bose. My latest is a 4 year old set of Bose noise-cancelling headphones and they were great, but the inner parts of the foam cushion is degrading rapidly. I have to say that these Sony headphones feel very light and comfortable, a sensation I much prefer over my older Bose headphones. But I'd tip my hat to my Bose for sound quality over the Sony, but again, I have high-frequency hearing loss."

After spending some time with them, I must say that these headphones truly live up to the hype in terms of audio quality, comfort, and advanced functionalities.\n\nThe sound quality is exceptional, delivering crisp highs, rich mids, and deep bass that make every listening experience immersive and enjoyable. The noise-canceling feature works wonders, effectively blocking out unwanted external sounds and allowing me to focus solely on my music or calls. Additionally, the hands-free calling feature ensures that conversations are clear and uninterrupted, even in noisy environments.\n\nHowever, my overall positive experience with these headphones was marred by an issue that arose upon receiving them. Despite purchasing them as new from Amazon, it became evident that the headphones had been previously paired with other devices. This resulted in setup complications with the 360 surround services and raised concerns about the authenticity of the product and Amazon's quality control processes.\nIt was disappointing to encounter such a setback with what should have been a brand-new product. I would advise potential buyers to exercise caution when purchasing these headphones from Amazon to ensure they receive a genuinely new and unopened product."

The sound quality is impeccable, offering rich, immersive audio that enhances every listening experience. From deep bass to crisp highs, they deliver an audio performance that never fails to impress.\n\nHowever, there's a glaring issue that has left me feeling disappointed – the hinges. I've gone through two different pairs of these headphones, and both times the hinges have proven to be their Achilles' heel. Despite being meticulous with their care, the frail plastic hinges simply couldn't withstand even the slightest pressure.\n\nAfter the hinges on my second pair gave in, I resorted to using gorilla glue in an attempt to salvage them. Unfortunately, this makeshift repair didn't last long, as they broke again, exacerbating the damage. Determined not to give up, I purchased an aftermarket hinge to perform my own repair. Yet, even with careful handling, one of the connector pieces snapped during the installation process, rendering the headphones unusable.\n\nGiven the premium price tag of these headphones, it's disheartening to see such fragility in a crucial component. If you decide to invest in these headphones, I urge you to handle them with extreme care and always store them in the case when not in use. Until Sony addresses this design flaw, I can't fully endorse these otherwise outstanding headphones."

I cannot imagine wearing these throughout a 4+ hour airplane flight.\nBut that's part of the extremely effective noise reduction.\nThe app's server connection was unreliable for me, and the login process far to \"secure\" with difficult capcha matches, and after each failure, one's password must be re-entered. But you don't need the app for excellent function.\nPositives:\n- Outstanding microphone noise cancellation. This is active all the time, whether or not ANC is on for listening.\nSpeaking over to phone from a coffee shop (ceiling music, arguing staff, dishes clanking, a family conversation and squalling baby 15 feet away), the listener could hear little or no background noise.\nIt is very, very hard to get any information on actual performance on noise-canceling mics in buds or headphones. I finally found soundboys-dot-com, who way down near the bottom of their reviews have actual recordings in standardized noisy environments.\nI've slowly migrated, over 6 years, through three units:\nFirst, an ANC open-ear headset with a boom mic that I assumed would work well because close to my mouth. My wife casually observed that I spoke very loudly when dictating, especially. I wrongly thought this because we don't hear our own voice well when our ears are covered.\nThen I forgot these on the train, and bought Beats for convenience -- the band and magnetic latches in the buds make loss difficult. These surprised me by having MUCH better mic performance -- never needed to raise my voice in a quiet environment for good speech recognition.\nBut in noisy environments (riding in a car or airplane. sitting an an airport waiting area, cafe, etc.), they failed. With dictation, I had to cup my hand over my mouth and the mic to avoid unseemly shouting, and then quickly hold the mic in my hand to suppress the noise during my silences.\nIt's interesting to me that voice recognition works better with ANC off, because then I hear my own speech volume more accurately and can modulate that realistically. Yes, one does need to speak louder in a very noisy environment, or simply talk into one's hand to reflect the sound back to the mics when one wants to be private.\nThese Sony headphones are exactly what I need.\nFor me, the excellent music quality is simply the frosting on the cake.\n- One can plug in a standard mini stereo plug and the phones just work.. (There are stereo to USB adapters readily available.)"

Not enough to make up for the XM2's better headband, better ear cup material, better ANC functions, & WAY better ruggedness.\n\nI have honestly abused my XM2s & even after 7 years of every day wear they are solid.\nJust now, in 2024 is the ear cup material beginning to crack a bit but that's after countless hours/ days/ weeks of wear doing everything from relaxing, to gaming, to working out, doing yard work, felling trees, playing sports.\nTons of drops, sometimes poor storage, taking hits from footballs, sweat, rain, etc.\nThe XM2s are awesome.\n\nWithin 1 month, I could tell the XM5s just wouldn't cut it.\nThey easily slip off your head when you're active.\nThe ANC function is annoying & didn't seem to keep as much sound out.\nSony straight up warns you that \"these cannot get wet. Avoid sweat\"\nYou can't sweat in these bro!?! What?!\nJust terrible.\n\nI'm gonna try a different brand until Sony makes some major changes with the XM line.\nGood luck everyone. 🍻"

The replacement came in around December and by February, I have a non-stop skipping noise going on in the background of whatever I am listening to.\n\nThese are not worth the price for the quality. The noise cancelling is not much better than a pair of 45 dollar headphones. If I do not want to hear other people with the noise canceling on, then I have to practically blast sound from these. The round design of the headphones also hurts the top of my head, they are usually flat on top for a reason it seems.\n\nI had been so excited to get a pair of quality headphones that would cancel out all of the loud sounds in my house but instead I wasted money on an inferior product that does not last more than two months at best. I always carry them in the case they come in and have done nothing that would damage the quality or performance of the headphones. To say I am disappointed would be an understatement."

However, I think the headphones themselves feel a little more fragile. The case also seems less sturdy, though it may just be a more efficient design. The only real complaint I have is the touch panel. It's very sensitive to hair, etc., and actually is triggered by simply moving my head or often nothing at all. It was really frustrated if it started clicking next and skipping through a queue of songs, so I turned off the touch controls entirely. I don't use them too much anyway and haven't missed them. BUT! Even though the touch control does not do anything now, it will still make the noise as if you are skipping a song. If only there were an update to stop that noise when the touch controls are off, I would be content with this workaround. PLEASE Sony, if you read this, just turn the touch noise off! I'm upset that $400 headphones have such a simple but significant design flaw which you can scour the internet to find discussions of, but as long as these headphones continue to offer superior sound quality, I would absolutely forgive and forget so long as I can turn the touch panel click off someday soon!"

Believe me when I say that I have never once felt uncomfortable while wearing these. The material is soft and lightweight—perfect for all day use. The controls are intuitive, too. My favorite feature of the headphones is that they turn into a microphone whenever I’m talking to someone, which means that I don’t have to take off my headphones every time I want to have a conversation. I can also quickly let noise in (like an announcement from my manager) by placing my palm over my right ear. This has come in handy many times!\n\nThe battery life is incredible, as is the sound quality. The noise cancellation technology is insanely good.

You can enjoy a movie as if watching in your living room without any noise.\n\nI paid around $430 for these headphones 5 months ago. One day they just fell apart.

A picture of the damage is attached.\n\nI contacted Sony and they refused to accept it as a quality issue. They term it as accidental damage and maintain that it is not cover under warranty. They just gave me the phone number of their contractor in Salt Lake City (I live in LA). Other than providing the phone number they could not help at all. They did not want to even listen to my argument that it was not an accidental damage but one of the joints (held with glue) just came off, so it was a manufacturing issue.\n\nThe contractor told me to ship the headphones to them at my own expense and they would charge me $90.00 just to tell me how much it would cost to repair, and then they would ship it back to me at my own expense.\n\nI have decided to write off the loss and buy Apple Air Pods Pro.

Two of the flights were 16 hours long each and I had hoped that these headphones will provide the noise cancellation so I can sleep. After reading so many reviews, I was hopeful that they will cancel out almost all of the noise on a plane. However, I found that this was not the case. I was able to hear almost everything like crying babies and people talking loudly, it muffled the sound, but it was still loud enough for me not to be able to sleep. They did drown out most of the plane ambient sound like engine noise. When I used them with earplugs in my ears, they helped cut out most of the sound. So that’s what I did for the plane journey where there were three crying babies around me.\n\nIf I listen to music with these headphones on, then they definitely cut out more sound than when I just run the noise cancellation. I had downloaded the app and tried to adjust the settings on that for better performance, but did not notice a big change. I don’t like using earbuds like AirPods, but I find that these are barely any better than my AirPods 2. They are very comfortable though, and I prefer them over the bulky AirPods Max. The sound is also pretty decent, but my main purpose was noise cancellation and it was a bit of letdown.\n\nThe battery life is truly phenomenal and lasted my journey of 25+ hours, with just one charge. They get sweaty only after multiple hours of usage, but better than anything else I have owned, these are the only headphones I was able to wear for 6 to 7 hours straight.\n\nI will carry them on any longer plane journey because they are better than anything else I own currently, but for this price I had hoped for even better noise cancellation."

The location based customization is fun, but ultimately when I'm wearing these I'm at work and pretty much just need as much noise cancelled out as possible to avoid distractions. The music quality is also nice, though my main concern for headphones was to be able to focus in a noisy office setting.\n\nCons: This headphone has issues working with teams video calls and zoom. I've looked through tutorials and troubleshooting to fix the settings, but I'm having to fix the settings before EACH call to make it work. I would suggest either getting a separate headset for those video calls, or consider another option for headphones. This was never an issue I experienced with the Bose.\n\nThe headphone case it came in is nice, but I had problems with the zipper immediately. It's been incredibly frustrating having to struggle with a faulty zipper just to get my headphones out so I can start my day. I've already had to undo part of the seam to reset the zipper twice, and will likely just replace the case or attach some velcro to keep the case closed. I have a hybrid work schedule, so having a semi hard case to protect the headphones matters to me.\n\nIn sum, if your main concern is noise cancellation and you have infrequent video calls, I would strongly recommend this product. Otherwise, there are likely better options on the market."

        "body": "Bought these to replace my aging Vmoda Crossfade II. Read a ton of reviews and decided to go for it. Out of the box, they sounded ok, but really came alive after messing around with EQ - using the Sony Connect app and/or a 3rd party EQ I've had for years. Very comfortable phones. Good sound imaging , great separation. Bass is punchy and tight after EQ changes; mids are fine and top end is pretty crisp and clear. There is a world of difference in sound between using my S22 Ultra and MacBook. Mac sound is pretty muddy and lacks presence. Using LiveOne on the S22 is 500% better; very clean and clear sonic attack. The Sony app is fine; lots (maybe too many) things to look at and think about. The thing I really don't like is how they feel when I handle them - very plastically - and honestly - kind of cheap feeling. Ear cup cover material seems low grade and a bit thin. And those ear cups - yucky feeling plastic. I would expect a better build quality (more solid feeling materials). Maybe the decision to go with plastic was a cost of design issue, in order tokeepp the price down and remain competitive. However, a product which sounds as good as these deserve better materials. Not sure if I'll keep them - need a few more days to make that decision. Bottom line: you gotta be your own judge, decide what trade offs you are willing to make to get the features you want and the that matter most. Also bought Boweres and Wilkins PX7 2Se. Will body them after trials.\n\nUpdate: I will be returning the Sony headphones. Although my comment about the plastic earcups still applies, I believe they would hold up as long as one was careful with them. Maybe the feel of the product is not important to you, but design and appearance count for me. Again the sound and features of the Sony is great."

        "body": "I've had these headphones (which I bought refurbished off Amazon) for almost a year now and they're nothing short of phenomenal! Sony is really good at maintaining the application tied to the headphone user and the fact that I've recieved a number of helpful updates since buying these headphones has been great. I use these everyday for casual gaming, studying, and going to the gym. I recommend being cautious when using these when you're sweating a lot at the gym due to the sensors having an affect on sweat. I've noticed that the detection system build into the headphones doesn't necessarily work anymore due to how often I've sweated while wearing these headphones. One annoyance that I have is the \"Speak to Chat Feature\" which keeps turning on whenever I talk at the gym. It might just be my headphones in particular but even if I go into the app and manually select to turn this feature off, it some how keeps coming back and turns itself on again. This is frustrating when you're in the middle of a set while exercising and then all of asudden the headphones pause the music and ambient mode is turned on. Regardless, amazing headphones and I'd recommend them for anyone. I was hesitant to buy these initially due to everyone stating they do not hold up well in the gym but they still function well enough for my liking!\n\nIn the second photo I posted, you can see the slight stain marks caused by usage in the gym. If you want to avoid this, getting the black colored headphones might be recommended. However, I have been able to clean these stains out with a cleaning wipe. Plus, these headphones don't leave finger prints on the headphones which I know first hand that the black ones do (which was annoying hence why I got the white ones)."

        "body": "This is another great product from Sony. However is over priced.\nIt has great sound, good noise cancellation and amazing battery life.\nThe downsides:\nExtremely expensive (the performance does not justify the price).\nNoise cancellation: if you take the headset off for a seconds, the noise cancellation functions goes away... crazy setting! you need to switch off and on again. Very annoying.\nVolume control: Sony decided to play Star Wars and removed the volume at all! same with any other switch that previous headset had... so now you only have a power-on switch, that it is! and to pair and control the volume I have the following word for you: GOOD LUCK!\nThe volume works with sliding you finger up or down. If you want to pause to tap twice. But hold on there, that you need to tap in the right spot, otherwise does not work (you might find yourself tapping your headset while walking, and it is hard to aim for the same spot!). The same with volume up and down. For some design reasons, the volume works in phases, so if you want to lower fully, you cannot, you are only able to lower bit by bit, repeating the action several times to get to the right volume. It is ridiculous. Takes a hell of a time and keep you busy with the device instead of enjoying your music/sound.\nThe issue is very similar than the smart watches that has digital (virtual) control over functions, instead of having a wheel that you can operate with your fingers any time, including while wearing gloves. If you have your hand wet or you are on the move, it is basically impossible to operate the device. The mechanical wheel is the answer. The same with this headset: why the hell Sony removed the volume and pairing buttons? I wont buy the next generation of headset if they carry on this way.\nThe device (headset) has been thought in a engineering environment, by engineers, not users. So it works precisely as the engineers defined, under the perfect conditions BUT life of the user is different. Try to volume up while entering a plane and having to carry your hand suitcase: impossible. Try to pair quickly with your rental car while on the go: impossible. The Sony headsets are a good piece of engineering but has huge challenges. My advise is to buy something alternative and not to spent so huge amount of money for a product that aim to re-invent the headset. Previous Sony headset did the job, was so hard to just improve on the comfort, the battery life and noise cancellation without the need of removing all switches in this new model? Avoid this model or learn to spend more time to try to control it than enjoying your music !"

The xm5s don’t have a feature to optimize noise cancelling based on environment so I winds up being ineffective in cancelling out noise 80% or the time. However I will say if you only care about sound quality then there is a noticeable upgrade in quality from previous gens. IMO I would say steer away from these if you are looking for good noise cancelling"

I also use the headphones at home to listen to books and occasionally music. I have considerable high-frequency hearing loss so I can't comment on the finer details of audio qualities. For me, the audio quality is excellent. Also, my only other experience with headphones are all from Bose. My latest is a 4 year old set of Bose noise-cancelling headphones and they were great, but the inner parts of the foam cushion is degrading rapidly. I have to say that these Sony headphones feel very light and comfortable, a sensation I much prefer over my older Bose headphones. But I'd tip my hat to my Bose for sound quality over the Sony, but again, I have high-frequency hearing loss."

After spending some time with them, I must say that these headphones truly live up to the hype in terms of audio quality, comfort, and advanced functionalities.\n\nThe sound quality is exceptional, delivering crisp highs, rich mids, and deep bass that make every listening experience immersive and enjoyable. The noise-canceling feature works wonders, effectively blocking out unwanted external sounds and allowing me to focus solely on my music or calls. Additionally, the hands-free calling feature ensures that conversations are clear and uninterrupted, even in noisy environments.\n\nHowever, my overall positive experience with these headphones was marred by an issue that arose upon receiving them. Despite purchasing them as new from Amazon, it became evident that the headphones had been previously paired with other devices. This resulted in setup complications with the 360 surround services and raised concerns about the authenticity of the product and Amazon's quality control processes.\nIt was disappointing to encounter such a setback with what should have been a brand-new product. I would advise potential buyers to exercise caution when purchasing these headphones from Amazon to ensure they receive a genuinely new and unopened product."

The sound quality is impeccable, offering rich, immersive audio that enhances every listening experience. From deep bass to crisp highs, they deliver an audio performance that never fails to impress.\n\nHowever, there's a glaring issue that has left me feeling disappointed – the hinges. I've gone through two different pairs of these headphones, and both times the hinges have proven to be their Achilles' heel. Despite being meticulous with their care, the frail plastic hinges simply couldn't withstand even the slightest pressure.\n\nAfter the hinges on my second pair gave in, I resorted to using gorilla glue in an attempt to salvage them. Unfortunately, this makeshift repair didn't last long, as they broke again, exacerbating the damage. Determined not to give up, I purchased an aftermarket hinge to perform my own repair. Yet, even with careful handling, one of the connector pieces snapped during the installation process, rendering the headphones unusable.\n\nGiven the premium price tag of these headphones, it's disheartening to see such fragility in a crucial component. If you decide to invest in these headphones, I urge you to handle them with extreme care and always store them in the case when not in use. Until Sony addresses this design flaw, I can't fully endorse these otherwise outstanding headphones."

        "body": "Negatives:\nThe band is tight. I cannot imagine wearing these throughout a 4+ hour airplane flight.\nBut that's part of the extremely effective noise reduction.\nThe app's server connection was unreliable for me, and the login process far to \"secure\" with difficult capcha matches, and after each failure, one's password must be re-entered. But you don't need the app for excellent function.\nPositives:\n- Outstanding microphone noise cancellation. This is active all the time, whether or not ANC is on for listening.\nSpeaking over to phone from a coffee shop (ceiling music, arguing staff, dishes clanking, a family conversation and squalling baby 15 feet away), the listener could hear little or no background noise.\nIt is very, very hard to get any information on actual performance on noise-canceling mics in buds or headphones. I finally found soundboys-dot-com, who way down near the bottom of their reviews have actual recordings in standardized noisy environments.\nI've slowly migrated, over 6 years, through three units:\nFirst, an ANC open-ear headset with a boom mic that I assumed would work well because close to my mouth. My wife casually observed that I spoke very loudly when dictating, especially. I wrongly thought this because we don't hear our own voice well when our ears are covered.\nThen I forgot these on the train, and bought Beats for convenience -- the band and magnetic latches in the buds make loss difficult. These surprised me by having MUCH better mic performance -- never needed to raise my voice in a quiet environment for good speech recognition.\nBut in noisy environments (riding in a car or airplane. sitting an an airport waiting area, cafe, etc.), they failed. With dictation, I had to cup my hand over my mouth and the mic to avoid unseemly shouting, and then quickly hold the mic in my hand to suppress the noise during my silences.\nIt's interesting to me that voice recognition works better with ANC off, because then I hear my own speech volume more accurately and can modulate that realistically. Yes, one does need to speak louder in a very noisy environment, or simply talk into one's hand to reflect the sound back to the mics when one wants to be private.\nThese Sony headphones are exactly what I need.\nFor me, the excellent music quality is simply the frosting on the cake.\n- One can plug in a standard mini stereo plug and the phones just work.. (There are stereo to USB adapters readily available.)"

The only real complaint I have is the touch panel. It's very sensitive to hair, etc., and actually is triggered by simply moving my head or often nothing at all. It was really frustrated if it started clicking next and skipping through a queue of songs, so I turned off the touch controls entirely. I don't use them too much anyway and haven't missed them. BUT! Even though the touch control does not do anything now, it will still make the noise as if you are skipping a song. If only there were an update to stop that noise when the touch controls are off, I would be content with this workaround. PLEASE Sony, if you read this, just turn the touch noise off! I'm upset that $400 headphones have such a simple but significant design flaw which you can scour the internet to find discussions of, but as long as these headphones continue to offer superior sound quality, I would absolutely forgive and forget so long as I can turn the touch panel click off someday soon!"

My favorite feature of the headphones is that they turn into a microphone whenever I’m talking to someone, which means that I don’t have to take off my headphones every time I want to have a conversation. I can also quickly let noise in (like an announcement from my manager) by placing my palm over my right ear.

The active noise canceling is ok, but not that much different than Wyze headphones which are a fraction of the cost. The Bluetooth doesn't connect as auto smoothly as others. The app is terrible. It's smart mode changing is not smart and the EQ isn't great. Bass is flat.\n\nGoing to try Sennheiser next or if budget Anker and report back."

Noise cancellation is very effective. Flying with these headphones is the best experience ever. You can enjoy a movie as if watching in your living room without any noise.\n\nI paid around $430 for these headphones 5 months ago. One day they just fell apart. One of the earpads detached from the headband during normal use. It looks it it was attached with glue and glue did not hold anymore. A picture of the damage is attached.\n\nI contacted Sony and they refused to accept it as a quality issue. They term it as accidental damage and maintain that it is not cover under warranty. They just gave me the phone number of their contractor in Salt Lake City (I live in LA). Other than providing the phone number they could not help at all. They did not want to even listen to my argument that it was not an accidental damage but one of the joints (held with glue) just came off, so it was a manufacturing issue.\n\nThe contractor told me to ship the headphones to them at my own expense and they would charge me $90.00 just to tell me how much it would cost to repair, and then they would ship it back to me at my own expense.\n\nI have decided to write off the loss and buy Apple Air Pods Pro. Top-notch customer service is guaranteed with Apple products, and you have Apple Stores to go to if you have an issue."

Two of the flights were 16 hours long each and I had hoped that these headphones will provide the noise cancellation so I can sleep. After reading so many reviews, I was hopeful that they will cancel out almost all of the noise on a plane. However, I found that this was not the case. I was able to hear almost everything like crying babies and people talking loudly, it muffled the sound, but it was still loud enough for me not to be able to sleep. They did drown out most of the plane ambient sound like engine noise. When I used them with earplugs in my ears, they helped cut out most of the sound. So that’s what I did for the plane journey where there were three crying babies around me.\n\nIf I listen to music with these headphones on, then they definitely cut out more sound than when I just run the noise cancellation. I had downloaded the app and tried to adjust the settings on that for better performance, but did not notice a big change. I don’t like using earbuds like AirPods, but I find that these are barely any better than my AirPods 2. They are very comfortable though, and I prefer them over the bulky AirPods Max. The sound is also pretty decent, but my main purpose was noise cancellation and it was a bit of letdown.\n\nThe battery life is truly phenomenal and lasted my journey of 25+ hours, with just one charge. They get sweaty only after multiple hours of usage, but better than anything else I have owned, these are the only headphones I was able to wear for 6 to 7 hours straight.\n\nI will carry them on any longer plane journey because they are better than anything else I own currently, but for this price I had hoped for even better noise cancellation."

The location based customization is fun, but ultimately when I'm wearing these I'm at work and pretty much just need as much noise cancelled out as possible to avoid distractions. The music quality is also nice, though my main concern for headphones was to be able to focus in a noisy office setting.\n\nCons: This headphone has issues working with teams video calls and zoom. I've looked through tutorials and troubleshooting to fix the settings, but I'm having to fix the settings before EACH call to make it work. I would suggest either getting a separate headset for those video calls, or consider another option for headphones. This was never an issue I experienced with the Bose.\n\nThe headphone case it came in is nice, but I had problems with the zipper immediately. It's been incredibly frustrating having to struggle with a faulty zipper just to get my headphones out so I can start my day. I've already had to undo part of the seam to reset the zipper twice, and will likely just replace the case or attach some velcro to keep the case closed. I have a hybrid work schedule, so having a semi hard case to protect the headphones matters to me.\n\nIn sum, if your main concern is noise cancellation and you have infrequent video calls, I would strongly recommend this product. Otherwise, there are likely better options on the market."

        "body": "Bought these to replace my aging Vmoda Crossfade II. Read a ton of reviews and decided to go for it. Out of the box, they sounded ok, but really came alive after messing around with EQ - using the Sony Connect app and/or a 3rd party EQ I've had for years. Very comfortable phones. Good sound imaging , great separation. Bass is punchy and tight after EQ changes; mids are fine and top end is pretty crisp and clear. There is a world of difference in sound between using my S22 Ultra and MacBook. Mac sound is pretty muddy and lacks presence. Using LiveOne on the S22 is 500% better; very clean and clear sonic attack. The Sony app is fine; lots (maybe too many) things to look at and think about. The thing I really don't like is how they feel when I handle them - very plastically - and honestly - kind of cheap feeling. Ear cup cover material seems low grade and a bit thin. And those ear cups - yucky feeling plastic. I would expect a better build quality (more solid feeling materials). Maybe the decision to go with plastic was a cost of design issue, in order tokeepp the price down and remain competitive. However, a product which sounds as good as these deserve better materials. Not sure if I'll keep them - need a few more days to make that decision. Bottom line: you gotta be your own judge, decide what trade offs you are willing to make to get the features you want and the that matter most. Also bought Boweres and Wilkins PX7 2Se. Will body them after trials.\n\nUpdate: I will be returning the Sony headphones. Although my comment about the plastic earcups still applies, I believe they would hold up as long as one was careful with them. Maybe the feel of the product is not important to you, but design and appearance count for me. Again the sound and features of the Sony is great."

        "body": "I've had these headphones (which I bought refurbished off Amazon) for almost a year now and they're nothing short of phenomenal! Sony is really good at maintaining the application tied to the headphone user and the fact that I've recieved a number of helpful updates since buying these headphones has been great. I use these everyday for casual gaming, studying, and going to the gym. I recommend being cautious when using these when you're sweating a lot at the gym due to the sensors having an affect on sweat. I've noticed that the detection system build into the headphones doesn't necessarily work anymore due to how often I've sweated while wearing these headphones. One annoyance that I have is the \"Speak to Chat Feature\" which keeps turning on whenever I talk at the gym. It might just be my headphones in particular but even if I go into the app and manually select to turn this feature off, it some how keeps coming back and turns itself on again. This is frustrating when you're in the middle of a set while exercising and then all of asudden the headphones pause the music and ambient mode is turned on. Regardless, amazing headphones and I'd recommend them for anyone. I was hesitant to buy these initially due to everyone stating they do not hold up well in the gym but they still function well enough for my liking!\n\nIn the second photo I posted, you can see the slight stain marks caused by usage in the gym. If you want to avoid this, getting the black colored headphones might be recommended. However, I have been able to clean these stains out with a cleaning wipe. Plus, these headphones don't leave finger prints on the headphones which I know first hand that the black ones do (which was annoying hence why I got the white ones)."

        "body": "This is another great product from Sony. However is over priced.\nIt has great sound, good noise cancellation and amazing battery life.\nThe downsides:\nExtremely expensive (the performance does not justify the price).\nNoise cancellation: if you take the headset off for a seconds, the noise cancellation functions goes away... crazy setting! you need to switch off and on again. Very annoying.\nVolume control: Sony decided to play Star Wars and removed the volume at all! same with any other switch that previous headset had... so now you only have a power-on switch, that it is! and to pair and control the volume I have the following word for you: GOOD LUCK!\nThe volume works with sliding you finger up or down. If you want to pause to tap twice. But hold on there, that you need to tap in the right spot, otherwise does not work (you might find yourself tapping your headset while walking, and it is hard to aim for the same spot!). The same with volume up and down. For some design reasons, the volume works in phases, so if you want to lower fully, you cannot, you are only able to lower bit by bit, repeating the action several times to get to the right volume. It is ridiculous. Takes a hell of a time and keep you busy with the device instead of enjoying your music/sound.\nThe issue is very similar than the smart watches that has digital (virtual) control over functions, instead of having a wheel that you can operate with your fingers any time, including while wearing gloves. If you have your hand wet or you are on the move, it is basically impossible to operate the device. The mechanical wheel is the answer. The same with this headset: why the hell Sony removed the volume and pairing buttons? I wont buy the next generation of headset if they carry on this way.\nThe device (headset) has been thought in a engineering environment, by engineers, not users. So it works precisely as the engineers defined, under the perfect conditions BUT life of the user is different. Try to volume up while entering a plane and having to carry your hand suitcase: impossible. Try to pair quickly with your rental car while on the go: impossible. The Sony headsets are a good piece of engineering but has huge challenges. My advise is to buy something alternative and not to spent so huge amount of money for a product that aim to re-invent the headset. Previous Sony headset did the job, was so hard to just improve on the comfort, the battery life and noise cancellation without the need of removing all switches in this new model? Avoid this model or learn to spend more time to try to control it than enjoying your music !"

Also they still look brand new!\nWhereas the Sony WH-1000MX5, the \"skin\" on the outer shell of the earmuffs: It wears off and peels very easily, just from normal use, and very quickly they look old."

The xm5s don’t have a feature to optimize noise cancelling based on environment so I winds up being ineffective in cancelling out noise 80% or the time. However I will say if you only care about sound quality then there is a noticeable upgrade in quality from previous gens. IMO I would say steer away from these if you are looking for good noise cancelling"

I also use the headphones at home to listen to books and occasionally music. I have considerable high-frequency hearing loss so I can't comment on the finer details of audio qualities. For me, the audio quality is excellent. Also, my only other experience with headphones are all from Bose. My latest is a 4 year old set of Bose noise-cancelling headphones and they were great, but the inner parts of the foam cushion is degrading rapidly. I have to say that these Sony headphones feel very light and comfortable, a sensation I much prefer over my older Bose headphones. But I'd tip my hat to my Bose for sound quality over the Sony, but again, I have high-frequency hearing loss."

After spending some time with them, I must say that these headphones truly live up to the hype in terms of audio quality, comfort, and advanced functionalities.\n\nThe sound quality is exceptional, delivering crisp highs, rich mids, and deep bass that make every listening experience immersive and enjoyable. The noise-canceling feature works wonders, effectively blocking out unwanted external sounds and allowing me to focus solely on my music or calls. Additionally, the hands-free calling feature ensures that conversations are clear and uninterrupted, even in noisy environments.\n\nHowever, my overall positive experience with these headphones was marred by an issue that arose upon receiving them. Despite purchasing them as new from Amazon, it became evident that the headphones had been previously paired with other devices. This resulted in setup complications with the 360 surround services and raised concerns about the authenticity of the product and Amazon's quality control processes.\nIt was disappointing to encounter such a setback with what should have been a brand-new product. I would advise potential buyers to exercise caution when purchasing these headphones from Amazon to ensure they receive a genuinely new and unopened product."

The sound quality is impeccable, offering rich, immersive audio that enhances every listening experience. From deep bass to crisp highs, they deliver an audio performance that never fails to impress.\n\nHowever, there's a glaring issue that has left me feeling disappointed – the hinges. I've gone through two different pairs of these headphones, and both times the hinges have proven to be their Achilles' heel. Despite being meticulous with their care, the frail plastic hinges simply couldn't withstand even the slightest pressure.\n\nAfter the hinges on my second pair gave in, I resorted to using gorilla glue in an attempt to salvage them. Unfortunately, this makeshift repair didn't last long, as they broke again, exacerbating the damage. Determined not to give up, I purchased an aftermarket hinge to perform my own repair. Yet, even with careful handling, one of the connector pieces snapped during the installation process, rendering the headphones unusable.\n\nGiven the premium price tag of these headphones, it's disheartening to see such fragility in a crucial component. If you decide to invest in these headphones, I urge you to handle them with extreme care and always store them in the case when not in use. Until Sony addresses this design flaw, I can't fully endorse these otherwise outstanding headphones."

I cannot imagine wearing these throughout a 4+ hour airplane flight.\nBut that's part of the extremely effective noise reduction.\nThe app's server connection was unreliable for me, and the login process far to \"secure\" with difficult capcha matches, and after each failure, one's password must be re-entered. But you don't need the app for excellent function.\nPositives:\n- Outstanding microphone noise cancellation. This is active all the time, whether or not ANC is on for listening.\nSpeaking over to phone from a coffee shop (ceiling music, arguing staff, dishes clanking, a family conversation and squalling baby 15 feet away), the listener could hear little or no background noise.\nIt is very, very hard to get any information on actual performance on noise-canceling mics in buds or headphones. I finally found soundboys-dot-com, who way down near the bottom of their reviews have actual recordings in standardized noisy environments.\nI've slowly migrated, over 6 years, through three units:\nFirst, an ANC open-ear headset with a boom mic that I assumed would work well because close to my mouth. My wife casually observed that I spoke very loudly when dictating, especially. I wrongly thought this because we don't hear our own voice well when our ears are covered.\nThen I forgot these on the train, and bought Beats for convenience -- the band and magnetic latches in the buds make loss difficult. These surprised me by having MUCH better mic performance -- never needed to raise my voice in a quiet environment for good speech recognition.\nBut in noisy environments (riding in a car or airplane. sitting an an airport waiting area, cafe, etc.), they failed. With dictation, I had to cup my hand over my mouth and the mic to avoid unseemly shouting, and then quickly hold the mic in my hand to suppress the noise during my silences.\nIt's interesting to me that voice recognition works better with ANC off, because then I hear my own speech volume more accurately and can modulate that realistically. Yes, one does need to speak louder in a very noisy environment, or simply talk into one's hand to reflect the sound back to the mics when one wants to be private.\nThese Sony headphones are exactly what I need.\nFor me, the excellent music quality is simply the frosting on the cake.\n- One can plug in a standard mini stereo plug and the phones just work.. (There are stereo to USB adapters readily available.)"

The noise cancelling is not much better than a pair of 45 dollar headphones. If I do not want to hear other people with the noise canceling on, then I have to practically blast sound from these. The round design of the headphones also hurts the top of my head, they are usually flat on top for a reason it seems.\n\nI had been so excited to get a pair of quality headphones that would cancel out all of the loud sounds in my house but instead I wasted money on an inferior product that does not last more than two months at best. I always carry them in the case they come in and have done nothing that would damage the quality or performance of the headphones. To say I am disappointed would be an understatement."

However, I think the headphones themselves feel a little more fragile. The case also seems less sturdy, though it may just be a more efficient design. The only real complaint I have is the touch panel. It's very sensitive to hair, etc., and actually is triggered by simply moving my head or often nothing at all. It was really frustrated if it started clicking next and skipping through a queue of songs, so I turned off the touch controls entirely. I don't use them too much anyway and haven't missed them. BUT! Even though the touch control does not do anything now, it will still make the noise as if you are skipping a song. If only there were an update to stop that noise when the touch controls are off, I would be content with this workaround. PLEASE Sony, if you read this, just turn the touch noise off! I'm upset that $400 headphones have such a simple but significant design flaw which you can scour the internet to find discussions of, but as long as these headphones continue to offer superior sound quality, I would absolutely forgive and forget so long as I can turn the touch panel click off someday soon!"

Believe me when I say that I have never once felt uncomfortable while wearing these. The material is soft and lightweight—perfect for all day use. The controls are intuitive, too. My favorite feature of the headphones is that they turn into a microphone whenever I’m talking to someone, which means that I don’t have to take off my headphones every time I want to have a conversation. I can also quickly let noise in (like an announcement from my manager) by placing my palm over my right ear. This has come in handy many times!\n\nThe battery life is incredible, as is the sound quality. The noise cancellation technology is insanely good.

You can enjoy a movie as if watching in your living room without any noise.\n\nI paid around $430 for these headphones 5 months ago. One day they just fell apart.

A picture of the damage is attached.\n\nI contacted Sony and they refused to accept it as a quality issue. They term it as accidental damage and maintain that it is not cover under warranty. They just gave me the phone number of their contractor in Salt Lake City (I live in LA). Other than providing the phone number they could not help at all. They did not want to even listen to my argument that it was not an accidental damage but one of the joints (held with glue) just came off, so it was a manufacturing issue.\n\nThe contractor told me to ship the headphones to them at my own expense and they would charge me $90.00 just to tell me how much it would cost to repair, and then they would ship it back to me at my own expense.\n\nI have decided to write off the loss and buy Apple Air Pods Pro.

Two of the flights were 16 hours long each and I had hoped that these headphones will provide the noise cancellation so I can sleep. After reading so many reviews, I was hopeful that they will cancel out almost all of the noise on a plane. However, I found that this was not the case. I was able to hear almost everything like crying babies and people talking loudly, it muffled the sound, but it was still loud enough for me not to be able to sleep. They did drown out most of the plane ambient sound like engine noise. When I used them with earplugs in my ears, they helped cut out most of the sound. So that’s what I did for the plane journey where there were three crying babies around me.\n\nIf I listen to music with these headphones on, then they definitely cut out more sound than when I just run the noise cancellation. I had downloaded the app and tried to adjust the settings on that for better performance, but did not notice a big change. I don’t like using earbuds like AirPods, but I find that these are barely any better than my AirPods 2. They are very comfortable though, and I prefer them over the bulky AirPods Max. The sound is also pretty decent, but my main purpose was noise cancellation and it was a bit of letdown.\n\nThe battery life is truly phenomenal and lasted my journey of 25+ hours, with just one charge. They get sweaty only after multiple hours of usage, but better than anything else I have owned, these are the only headphones I was able to wear for 6 to 7 hours straight.\n\nI will carry them on any longer plane journey because they are better than anything else I own currently, but for this price I had hoped for even better noise cancellation."

The location based customization is fun, but ultimately when I'm wearing these I'm at work and pretty much just need as much noise cancelled out as possible to avoid distractions. The music quality is also nice, though my main concern for headphones was to be able to focus in a noisy office setting.\n\nCons: This headphone has issues working with teams video calls and zoom. I've looked through tutorials and troubleshooting to fix the settings, but I'm having to fix the settings before EACH call to make it work. I would suggest either getting a separate headset for those video calls, or consider another option for headphones. This was never an issue I experienced with the Bose.\n\nThe headphone case it came in is nice, but I had problems with the zipper immediately. It's been incredibly frustrating having to struggle with a faulty zipper just to get my headphones out so I can start my day. I've already had to undo part of the seam to reset the zipper twice, and will likely just replace the case or attach some velcro to keep the case closed. I have a hybrid work schedule, so having a semi hard case to protect the headphones matters to me.\n\nIn sum, if your main concern is noise cancellation and you have infrequent video calls, I would strongly recommend this product. Otherwise, there are likely better options on the market."

Out of the box, they sounded ok, but really came alive after messing around with EQ - using the Sony Connect app and/or a 3rd party EQ I've had for years. Very comfortable phones. Good sound imaging , great separation. Bass is punchy and tight after EQ changes; mids are fine and top end is pretty crisp and clear. There is a world of difference in sound between using my S22 Ultra and MacBook. Mac sound is pretty muddy and lacks presence. Using LiveOne on the S22 is 500% better; very clean and clear sonic attack. The Sony app is fine; lots (maybe too many) things to look at and think about. The thing I really don't like is how they feel when I handle them - very plastically - and honestly - kind of cheap feeling. Ear cup cover material seems low grade and a bit thin. And those ear cups - yucky feeling plastic. I would expect a better build quality (more solid feeling materials). Maybe the decision to go with plastic was a cost of design issue, in order tokeepp the price down and remain competitive. However, a product which sounds as good as these deserve better materials. Not sure if I'll keep them - need a few more days to make that decision. Bottom line: you gotta be your own judge, decide what trade offs you are willing to make to get the features you want and the that matter most. Also bought Boweres and Wilkins PX7 2Se. Will body them after trials.\n\nUpdate: I will be returning the Sony headphones. Although my comment about the plastic earcups still applies, I believe they would hold up as long as one was careful with them. Maybe the feel of the product is not important to you, but design and appearance count for me. Again the sound and features of the Sony is great."

Since then, I have not been able to use the headphones. I have not had this issue with other headsets in similar situations."

        "body": "These headphones to everything I want them to do. They sound great, have great battery life, and easy to use touch controls.\n\nThe noise cancellation could be slightly better, but nothing is perfect. Down the road, I also worry a bit about the matte rubberized coating coming off like it tends to do on plastic products over time, but for now, these are great.\n\nThe included case is a bonus. Makes them far less prone to damage when travelling."

        "body": "I've had these headphones (which I bought refurbished off Amazon) for almost a year now and they're nothing short of phenomenal! Sony is really good at maintaining the application tied to the headphone user and the fact that I've recieved a number of helpful updates since buying these headphones has been great. I use these everyday for casual gaming, studying, and going to the gym. I recommend being cautious when using these when you're sweating a lot at the gym due to the sensors having an affect on sweat. I've noticed that the detection system build into the headphones doesn't necessarily work anymore due to how often I've sweated while wearing these headphones. One annoyance that I have is the \"Speak to Chat Feature\" which keeps turning on whenever I talk at the gym. It might just be my headphones in particular but even if I go into the app and manually select to turn this feature off, it some how keeps coming back and turns itself on again. This is frustrating when you're in the middle of a set while exercising and then all of asudden the headphones pause the music and ambient mode is turned on. Regardless, amazing headphones and I'd recommend them for anyone. I was hesitant to buy these initially due to everyone stating they do not hold up well in the gym but they still function well enough for my liking!\n\nIn the second photo I posted, you can see the slight stain marks caused by usage in the gym. If you want to avoid this, getting the black colored headphones might be recommended. However, I have been able to clean these stains out with a cleaning wipe. Plus, these headphones don't leave finger prints on the headphones which I know first hand that the black ones do (which was annoying hence why I got the white ones)."

        "body": "This is another great product from Sony. However is over priced.\nIt has great sound, good noise cancellation and amazing battery life.\nThe downsides:\nExtremely expensive (the performance does not justify the price).\nNoise cancellation: if you take the headset off for a seconds, the noise cancellation functions goes away... crazy setting! you need to switch off and on again. Very annoying.\nVolume control: Sony decided to play Star Wars and removed the volume at all! same with any other switch that previous headset had... so now you only have a power-on switch, that it is! and to pair and control the volume I have the following word for you: GOOD LUCK!\nThe volume works with sliding you finger up or down. If you want to pause to tap twice. But hold on there, that you need to tap in the right spot, otherwise does not work (you might find yourself tapping your headset while walking, and it is hard to aim for the same spot!). The same with volume up and down. For some design reasons, the volume works in phases, so if you want to lower fully, you cannot, you are only able to lower bit by bit, repeating the action several times to get to the right volume. It is ridiculous. Takes a hell of a time and keep you busy with the device instead of enjoying your music/sound.\nThe issue is very similar than the smart watches that has digital (virtual) control over functions, instead of having a wheel that you can operate with your fingers any time, including while wearing gloves. If you have your hand wet or you are on the move, it is basically impossible to operate the device. The mechanical wheel is the answer. The same with this headset: why the hell Sony removed the volume and pairing buttons? I wont buy the next generation of headset if they carry on this way.\nThe device (headset) has been thought in a engineering environment, by engineers, not users. So it works precisely as the engineers defined, under the perfect conditions BUT life of the user is different. Try to volume up while entering a plane and having to carry your hand suitcase: impossible. Try to pair quickly with your rental car while on the go: impossible. The Sony headsets are a good piece of engineering but has huge challenges. My advise is to buy something alternative and not to spent so huge amount of money for a product that aim to re-invent the headset. Previous Sony headset did the job, was so hard to just improve on the comfort, the battery life and noise cancellation without the need of removing all switches in this new model? Avoid this model or learn to spend more time to try to control it than enjoying your music !"
