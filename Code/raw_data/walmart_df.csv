BrayG,3,Great Headphones but get the the MX4,4/30/2023,"I bought these for in December and they broke after 4 months. The band has a weak spot above the ear muffs and breaks apart. I purchased the protection plus plan from Sony, which states that it covers accidents and manufacturers defects. These broke easily and it will be hard to proved it wasn't an accident. It appears to be a design flaw, so thank goodness I bought the Sony Protection Plus Plan"
Joy,1,Never received item,12/13/2023,"My interactions with this company have been ridiculous. I didn't realize that I wasn't purchasing from Walmart directly (my mistake - will not do that again). I got the delivery confirmation from Walmart, but nothing was delivered. Our ring doorbell also showed no activity anywhere near the supposed delivery time. I reached out to Walmart via chat and they contacted the seller. Seller emailed me and said that they confirmed delivery with the driver - not true. There are no pictures and nothing was delivered. I contacted the Walmart chat again. They reached back out to the seller again. They then responded with they needed 7 - 10 days to open a case with the delivery service. This was a Christmas gift, so clearly this doesn't work. I'm not sure why Walmart even messes with these third party sellers. This is a nightmare. I've spent several hundred dollars on something that never arrived. I can't comment on the quality of the headphones because I never received them. The company, 6Wave is awful though. I do not recommend making any purchases through them."
Tack23,5,Great sounding headphones,9/20/2023,"I purchased these headphones 1 month ago all I can say is there just awesome , I happen to own many different pairs and these buy far are the best ones I would recommend great sound the noise canceling is outstanding what I really like is the Sony App it really has some great features , don't pass this up you won't regret it !"
lefitasi,5,Gift for teen,12/5/2023,I bought this for my nephew who used it on the airplane ride back home and it made his flight more pleasant. His flight was 7 hours long and he barely heard a thing. My nephew says it is worth the money.
nati,5,Satisfied,1/4/2024,The off white Sony headphones are amazing. They truly surpass my expectations. The sound is incredible. It allows you to enjoy music at another level.

Soulja4Christ,5,Pretty advanced noise cancelation.,3/25/2024,"The only downside is the app functionality, it regularly needs to be reset as if just installed."
Hari,5,I can say good not excellent,9/24/2023,Feature should have optimized more as some times we can't hear opposite voice properly where you should connect back.. noise cancellation is 7.5/10
eZioAud,5,excellent quality,10/15/2023,prompt shipping and competitive pricing. the headphone itself is outstanding in its quality and noise cancelling ability.
PapawFitz,5,Great sound and noise cancelling,6/29/2023,Hard to describe how great the sound is. It wirelessly connects to my 7.1 Sony amp and Sony Bravia XR-65A95K TV. The noise cancelling feature is incredible also. Fitz
Dean,5,Satisfied with purchase.,12/3/2023,Works as advertised. Quick delivery.
Kat93,5,Quiet,10/5/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are by far the best noise canceling headphones by Sony! They fit comfortably and you can adjust the bass and treble. Your music will automatically pause if you take them off. Overall awesome sound quality! If you have the money these will not disappoint.
Justme45,5,WH-1000XM5 WIRELESS HEADPHONES ROCK,10/27/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I wear headphones everyday for my job , and for fun . I have been threw alot of headphones cheap to expensive, and by far I love these. They are noise canceling, easy to use, Bluetooth, and the best part is if you move them off your ear, it automatically pauses your stuff. So no more having to stop and pause manually which helps especially for my job. I'm love they come with a really nice case, easy-to-use, and carry anywhere. You will love these . The quality alone is so good. Just love them. They last forever before you charge them. The best I say for sure. Obsessed!!"
Z,1,Didn't receive the product,11/3/2023,Didn't receive the product and seller is not refunding
Slaysr,5,Noise cancellation is amazingly,10/18/2023,Researched multiple products and found Sony to out perform the rest.
hala,5,"Good quality, noise canceling",9/27/2023,"Good quality, as in the description"
Yamen,5,Best in the industry!!!,11/21/2023,Good quality as expected Love the product.
Cornel G,5,Best noise canceling on phone calls,8/13/2022,"There are a lot of noise canceling headsets on the market but even popular brands are not offering any support for phone calls. They are mostly focused on the person that wear the headsets not the person on the other end of the line. I would not be wrong if I tell you that they are making the things worse for the other person, by amplifying the background noise not the person's voice. WH-1000XM5 on the other hand are different and deserve 5 stars for that. I was able to have a normal conversation over the phone while walking outside in regular city traffic. I am not living in a big city like LA or NY but these headsets may perform well even there. My wife told me that I sound like I am in the office. The battery life is very good; I wear these for 3 weeks now listening on them 30 min every weekday and so far I didn't charge them at all. I like also the audio quality though so far I used these only for podcasts with limited music content. Now for the not so good part. When I turn the ANC on, I can feel the noise cancelling kicking in, but I can still hear helicopters, airplanes, noisy traffic or even wind. I do believe that a larger ear cup with more foam could help with this issue. I heard that the ear cups are smaller than on WH-1000XM4 and frankly I would prefer these to be a bit larger. Also the manual shows these as not being sweat proof and unfortunately after wearing these for a half an hour I do find sweat under the ear cups. When I turn my head left or right it will increase the noise that comes from the outside. Not sure if it's related to the headband being more rigid or to the frame of my sunglasses keeping the cups at a certain distance from the ear. The tactile control works good, is responsive, and provides feedback similar to the airpods, but I should read the manual to learn about all the features. Overall I am pleased with the purchase and I would recommend this product. PS: I didn't own the WH-1000XM4 but I listened to some audio samples in a review and WH-1000XM5 seems to do a better job on noise canceling than WH-1000XM4."
alfunzoA,4,"overall, great",7/5/2022,"the headset it's self is amazing. the sound is wonderful, they are very comfortable and they look amazing all while having the best Active Noise Canceling around. 4/5 because of the app. the interface is not comfortable and more customizable widgets would be greatly appreciated"
Honeymooner66,5,Outstanding ANC,10/11/2022,"I bought these last month for my honeymoon trip to Hawaii. The back and forth was about 15 hours of wear time. Wow the ANC is the best. Very light weight, so comfortable and I didn't have to take my earring out. I loved when I took off the headphones my movie downloaded on my Fire tablet stops, pauses and then restarts when you put them back on, seamless. And SO quiet, since I got home I have started using them to listen to books, very peaceful and I can't hear my husband asking me any dumb questions. The shape of the case is great I love the flatness, it fits in my carry-on so much better, fit's perfectly on my tablet when stowed. My old earphones that came in a big ball carry case was so awkward. Outstanding product."
Flix1999,4,Great features,6/28/2023,I bought this 2 months ago very impressed with the noise cancelling and phone call quality.
Radwa,5,Great features !!,10/13/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am so happy with this sony headphones!! The sound quality is amazing, It's so soft. The material is so soft and the features is great. You can skip or pause by clicking with your finger. It is so comfortable and has great noise cancellation. The design is so neat and stylish it has a clean look. The best thing about it is the cup is big and it didn't hurt my ears. But the only thing concern about is the case holder is kinda big. Yet it is stylish and neat it has a magnet inside to hold your charger. Overall i am happy with it . And highly recommend it."
Emmanuelsdd,4,"Good sound, not able to keep clean",10/27/2022,I think the only thing I’m going to complain about is that you can’t touch these headphones with out getting them dirty. The only way is to wear gloves anytime you’re going to use them.
Carramrod,5,Sony headphone review,11/11/2022,"I got these as a gift. They are comfortable, lightweight and have a great sound quality. The ANC works great. The headphones app works great, it gives you good control.over the settings."
Sylvo91,5,Best headphone,10/15/2022,I bought them to edit film they are amazing and are the best purchased I ever made.

Al46,5,Superb headphones,6/29/2022,Tested product on numerous flights and noise cancelling did not disappoint
Janell86,5,Luxury at its finest,10/6/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Absolutely beautiful and all around superb quality. The noise canceling is the top of the line . Cushion is the best . The light weight of these headphones are what I love the most . The feel of them everything is top of the line . Bass is impeccable and charging is fast and lasts so long . I'm beyond impressed with these and will definitely be staying with them and this brand .
Hari,4,Great audio,11/10/2023,The audio is great. If only it was sweat proof.
ABGregory58,5,Love it!,10/20/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My Grand Daughter is autistic and can't stand certain noises and these wireless noise cancelling headphones help her to be able to read and also focus on the work she needs to do at school, especially when she is doing tests. These are great quality and work great!"
OCsiren,5,Great Product,10/12/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Sony - WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones work great. I love the design of them and how comfortable and lightweight they are. The sound is great and they do cancel out any other sounds. They charge quickly which is good. The case is also very nice.
Tory,5,Excellent headphones with great features,10/8/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It has really nice features, such as noise cancelation, chat mode, transparency mode, connects to multiple devices at once, it has really long battery life, 3 minutes of charging can get you 3 hours of battery life. Do the software update downloading the app. It's needed to improve quality sound when connecting to a smart Tv"
Cathy766,5,The best!,10/4/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I can't say enough awesome things about these headphones! I have been looking for a really good pair of headphones for my workouts and these were just the ticket! They have VERY clear sound and work wonderfully; I just love them. The best brand I've ever tried.
Jpowell1627,5,Great headphones,10/10/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got these because I need new headphones and I could not be happier super easy to use they are made out of high-quality products and has great sound can hear all the highs and lows when using and they also have a great battery life super impressed I highly recommend
antv,5,Amazing headphones!,10/19/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are an amazing pair of bluetooth headphones. When listening to music, the sound is rich and the bass is deep. They fit snugly over your head and not too tightly over the ears. The most outstanding feature I would say is the noise cancellation. For work I am often on conference calls. These headphones do a great job of getting rid of the ambient noise and focusing on just my voice. Definitely recommend!"
FireFlyJj,5,Wireless headphones,10/10/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Let me tell you. The packaging was great with the little black case they came in. You cannot hear anything once you have them playing something. They are comfortable easy on ears
Kenziemarie10,5,Great product,10/10/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones are great headphones! They work amazing
cmodeg,1,Broke in less than two months.,9/12/2022,The headphones were good while they worked. They broke in less than two months.
Dan12345,2,Had to return,8/17/2022,And the three model and that was really good until it broke. And then for my birthday I thought I'd get the five model since it was like the best in class. But using it to mow the yard it would noise cancel and then about 10 minutes later it would go back off again for about 10 or 15 minutes and then back on again. And when using it at home to black out kid noises or grandkid noises it never really seem to block out much that I could tell and so my Apple AirPod pros I'll just have to live with those.
Estefany,4,The coolest features,9/17/2022,"I bought these over a month ago and definitely have to say, they have the coolest features. Comparing to the AirPod Pro max headset … and the price of it —- to these Sony headphones- Sony wins , it's definitely worth it. Beats apples price , beats the basic apple features. However my head is pretty small and I wish it had more shorter adjustable features ; it's definitely better than the Beats Solo 3 pro with the head size adjustment, not slippery and is more sturdy . I'm not the biggest fan of the power button nor the case , but the headphones alone, perform really well and the battery life is also a very nice plus !"
Emmanuelsdd,4,"Good sound, not able to keep clean",10/27/2022,I think the only thing I'm going to complain about is that you can't touch these headphones with out getting them dirty. The only way is to wear gloves anytime you're going to use them.
Taylor13t,5,Great sounds,12/4/2022,Have it wireless to my phone to my TV so I can listen even to my game system on the headphones everything sounds so great can't hear anything going on around me on the outside .I love them.
Alex,5,Great buy!,11/20/2023,Great price and super fast delivery!
Chaithanya,4,Excellent noise cancellation,8/15/2023,These headphones have enabled me to do household tasks and be on calls without the other person complaining of the noises. Before this I often had to stop doing such tasks due to complaints of disturbances. The main reason for this being rated 4 and not 5 is because it is not comfortable to wear continuously for over 2 hours. I am able to wear my Sony WHCH700N for up to 5 hours comfortably and expected the same with these new ones too.
Brandon,2,Poor packing of item,9/19/2023,"My package arrived with the box broken or torn open. Headphones that cost hundreds of dollars were clearly visible. There was minimal packing materials inside to protect the product. It's hard to verify whether I even received a new item because of the condition of the shipment. It's a miracle I got to the package in my lobby before someone grabbed the headphones straight out of the box. Yes, packages get damaged in transit, but quality packing is a huge part of deterring that. It's also a choice to use FedEx. Just know that your stuff might not arrive correct. Might be safer to purchase from a different seller."
Knorris,5,Knorris,1/25/2024,"Well I'm going to buy the 77 inch Sony TV in March so I thought I would purchase these headphones because they will be able to match up and I can hear attach them or connect to the TV and able to adjust the sound in my headphones, so I have been using these to listen to music and the sound and quality is unbelievable. I am very happy with my purchase."
DJ_Rusty,5,Extreme Comfort and Fantastic Sound!,8/7/2023,I purchased this 2 weeks ago and it really has exceeded my expectations! The fit is so comfortable that I can wear these for hours without any discomfort. And the sound - I am hearing small details in my favorite songs that I never heard before! So amazing!
Anon,5,Excellent sound and microphone,11/14/2023,I currently own the Bose QC Ultra and recently purchased the 1000XM5. The sound is exceptional on both but where Sony beats Bose is on phone calls. The microphone on the Sony's 1000XM5 is far superior than the microphone on the Bose QC Ultra.
Arty801,5,Game Changer!,6/29/2023,"I upgraded from XM2 to XM5, what an improvement. Since the noise cancelation is so amazing, I actually like to hear music and audio books at a lower volume. I love doing yard work with it, especially during mowing my lawn or using my electric power tools. When on the phone, the other side doesn't know I am mowing my lawn."
TitaV,5,"G8 sound, noise cancelling & custom features",7/27/2023,"I've had mine for a couple of months now and I'm still finding my personal customizations. The sound is amazing as is the noise cancelling. Phone calls are clear and overall one of the best headphones I've purchased, and I've purchased plenty over 50 plus years!!"
Rocco P,1,"Great sound and battery, until it broke",1/29/2023,Headphones are extremely flimsy and one side snapped off in just 3 months.
Ethan,3,there alright,2/24/2024,"they are just ok dont feel they are worth the price tag, seem smaller the previous model."
Mystery,5,Gym Boost,11/25/2023,"Love these headphones, noise canceling or reduction either if you prefer, it's amazing and easy to use plus easy to clean."
sean,5,personal experience,11/21/2023,they made my last flights much more comfortable by being able to listen to the music and movies with no background noise.
Cheryl,5,"",1/1/2024,Gift for my nephew..he loves them
EFerg,5,Extreme quality sound and product!,10/9/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony WH-1000XM5 has an excellent quality on sound, product and presentation! Again, Sony doesn't disappoint. The product presentation was high class. The case that stores the headphones is super nice and has a spot for the cables. Let's get to the good part, sound. The noise canceling was very noticeable. The sound is, quality to the max! I watched a movie and it was great, I took a phone call and it was great. The phone call, person on other end could kinda hear a conversation going on in background (about 6ft away) but my voice was the more prominent. I love the memory foam cushions around the ear and headband which makes for hours of listening time. Connection to my phone was a breeze."
Corrina47,5,Just great,10/1/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Wow, these Sony Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones are great. They cancel out all noise, they feel so comfortable over my ears, they are very stylish. They are made for iPhone/iPad and it also has Alexa built in. I highly recommend these Sony Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones."
kkelly,4,Great Noise Canceling Sony Headphones!,10/7/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Sony Noise Canceling headphones are excellent! So many great features with these headphones and has a great collapsible carrying case and the charge last up to 30 hours. These wireless headphones are comfortable and have touch controls so you can pause, play or control the volume."
Moe,2,"OK Device, Egregious Price, Music Lovers Be Warned",4/1/2023,"I had high expectation and boy was I disappointed! $400 price tag? Nope. Sound: The drivers are fairly capable and the built-in amplification is adequate, giving these headphones pretty good definition, and I could hear details clearly. But that's about where the good news end: the tonality is horrible. Deeply boosted low end takes away energy from low-mid; high-mid is okay but not as tamed and smooth as it should be, resulting sometimes harsh and sibilant treble; highs over 10k Hz are just nonexistent. The EQ with the companion app is rather useless in that there are so few bands to choose from, and non of the bands they've provided can fix the troubled frequency regions. I've tried all possible combinations and it was impossible to make it sound anywhere natural and musical enough for any genre other than maybe Pop and Hip-hop. The wired connection has an even worse frequency response profile so I think it's safe to say Sony did not intend this pair of headphones for Hi-fi listeners at all, which makes their LDAC gimmick completely useless here. Comfort: Padding is the shallowest I've ever seen on any headphones, and the headbands are a curious circular shaped. The result? It starts to become irritatingly uncomfortable for me after just 20 minutes of wearing. I keep finding myself needing to adjust it from time to time, while my studio monitors can fit comfily for hours at a time. ANC: coming from ANC earbuds mostly, XM5's system sound and feel weak to me. When compared to Airpods Pro 2, it felt quite different with more high frequencies but less low frequencies dampened. Maybe not worse, but certainly not better either. But compared to Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II? It is noticeably less effective, which it really shouldn't be given the high price tag. Verdict: musicality wise the XM5 will lose to most wired studio headphones $150 and above; convenience wise it will lose to most TWS earbuds; ANC is ok but definitely not top-notch; and it has questionable ergonomics. I love Sony's studio headphones but this one, it simply ain't it. If the XM5 retails for $250 and goes on sale for $200, it might be a competent pick; but as it stands for now, there are simply superior options at lower prices, making it IMHO a worthless buy for just about everyone. 3 stars for the hardware, minus one for the absurd price."
dhhsciences,5,Good and Solid,10/13/2023,Tested them all. This is the best one I tried so far.
Jonathan,5,It was easy and the price was right,9/2/2023,It was easy and the price was right
HC,4,Solid headphones,11/14/2023,Solid build quality and sound.
the greek god,5,replacement for JBL,9/4/2023,"these are a replacement for JBL headphones, i am very pleased"
Happy in So Cal,5,Great Product!,6/28/2023,"Bought it a few months back and works as advertised. No issues, comfortable to wear and sounds great!"
The_Scient1st,5,My new go-to headphones,7/5/2022,"These are absolutely amazing. I recently took them on a trip and first of all the noise cancelling made it so I could barely hear anything of the plane engine while I was flying. The sound quality is crystal clear, and all of the smart functions are very very cool. I also like this case a lot compared to older ones (I also have a pair of h.ear MDR-100ABN) because it is flatter and has a nice compartment for the wires. Overall, it feels like Sony has thought through every aspect of how to make an excellent headphone and executed it."
HolyJoe,5,"Long-lasting, good noise-cancelling",2/13/2023,"Battery: I wear my headphones the whole day (5-10 hours) listening to music and attending Zoom calls. These headphones last anywhere from 2-4 days depending on the use, and they charge really fast (one time, 50% in 30 minutes). Sound: They sound great! Sometimes when Discord (which means this might be a problem with Discord) uses the headphone as input at the same time as output, everything sounds terrible. However, when I use my actual separate mic, the issue is fixed immediately. Mic: do not use so I don't know Hand motions: Very easy to use and handy, especially on mobile Noise cancelling: The noise cancelling is so good I don't hear when people open my office door that is about 10 feet away from me. I wore them on the plane the other day and they worked great. The only problem is when the headphones don't completely cover your ears, the noise cancelling effect is useless on the plane. This presents a problem when I'm chewing, for example, because every time my jaw opens it creates a little space between ear and headphone. This is only a problem on the plane; otherwise chewing does not noticeably affect noise cancelling. Overall, I am very happy with the noise cancelling. These are my first noise-cancelling headphones, though, so I don't have much to compare them to. Connection: Once paired, these headphones connect to my computer within 5 seconds of turning both devices on. Usually I use them while I'm sitting right in front of my computer, and I very rarely have problems with songs ""buffering"" or cutting out for a split second. Being further away, (15-50 feet is the range I've tried) this buffering is more common, sometimes happening more than every 10 seconds, but sometimes not happening at all."
Irish99,3,"Great speaker sound, poor microphones",2/1/2023,"This is a great set of headphones, typical for Sony, in terms of construction and output sound quality. But the integral microphone does not live up to the description. Even when used in a quiet room, it does work as well as even an inexpensive boom microphone."
Sergon,5,Improved quality,6/3/2022,"WH-1000XM5 has a more balanced frequency response compared to the WH-1000XM3. It also does a better job with noise canceling. I really enjoyed the fact that you don't feel as much pressure in your ears due to the ANC, and I find myself using the headphones microphone this time around due to the improved microphone and it does a decent job at canceling the surrounding noise. The added features makes this headphones easier to use and it seems to be more responsive to inputs."
Marlvern,1,"",6/19/2023,"they are just overrated, you can't jog with these they are too big 🙆🏿‍♂️ lm return them"
BSLMPP,5,Amazing Noise Canceling and Sound,6/14/2022,"I upgraded from the Xm-2 for the Xm-5, and am very glad I did. Wonderful headphone, with class leading noise canceling and sound. They are also very light and completely comfortable and create no fatigue after extended listening."
BabyGQsuave,5,"Great features, comfortable to wear, Great App.",10/4/2022,Bought it about a month and half ago. I love the sony app and it's EQ settings. Very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. ANC is amazing and almost on par with Bose! Overall great product no regrets on purchasing.
zihaooo,5,A headphone close to perfect,2/13/2023,"Pros: Comfortable, Good on ANC, High-quality audio when using wire. Cons: Annoying touch/gesture functions, cannot use the microphone when using wire."
wineconcierge,5,superb stuff,7/5/2022,they live up to the hype. very comfortable and shield quite a bit of airplane noise and screaming babies. able to focus when wearing. great phone mic. haven't tested the music quality
Pastorptcc,5,Love them,9/30/2022,"I bought these about a month ago because I deal with tinnitus I need a good noise canceling headphones. These are amazing, best headphones I’ve ever had."
Blueberry333,4,Sounds amazing but battery life is not good,6/27/2022,"It seems like they die quickly, I charge them fully and they only last like 3 days. When I only listen to them a couple of hours a day. I don’t think they last 80 hours at all."
suitmar13,1,No Durability,12/10/2022,"Yes, this is one of the greatest headphones ever, but it's not that durable, as the earcups is dangling off. I would rather spend my money on the xm4. Don't buy this. Not a great product."
Mrmoemoe,5,Awesome Headphones,11/22/2022,After having the XM's4 I had to upgrade too the xm5 and believe me they are worth the upgrade...
Trevor,4,The new standard for best ANC,10/6/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Look no further for your new headphones, these are it. Unboxing alone is a treat with these headphones. Throw the box in the recycle bin and you're good to go. It is a little sad to see no quick start guide with the included paperwork however. The quick start guide is now a QR code on the box containing the legal paperwork (which is only two sheets, so it's not that much). The headphone case has a nice feel to it and has a nice magnetized compartment for holding the USB-C cable as well as an aux. cable. The USB-C cable is actually rather sad because it is only a 6"" long cable that will really only get you by in a pinch. The compartment in the case is rather small, so I assume 6"" is the best fit, and you most likely already have a good USB-C charger, so having this stowed away for emergency use is probably the best idea. Aside from that, you are treated to the main course - the head phones themselves. I work in an office environment and tend to wear my headphones for ~6-8 hours a day while at my desk. These things are a dream. They are super lightweight and, while noticeable, certainly aren't a burden on my head. The cushioning is super soft and very pleasant on the head and ears. The finish on these headphones is a nice matte black - however, it is very prone to smudges and markings especially with any amount of grease or any residue on your hands/fingers (so make sure you wash your hands!). Turning on the headphones brings me into a completely new environment. I have a constant ~50 dB fan blowing behind me in my office and while I can still head it through the ANC it's only barely there - and that's with no audio playing in the headphones. Gone are the sounds of the AC/Heater and any footsteps or quiet talking in the halls. And then you get audio playing and everything in your room completely disappears to the sounds coming from your headphones. The ANC on these is amazing. There is no white noise that the headphones create when cancelling the sound like other ANC headphones. They really are next level. And the audio is really good with the headphones. I am no audiophile, but I feel like the sound is a little closed, otherwise, everything sounds great. On the other end of the spectrum is the ambient mode. It's not as good, unfortunately. When using strictly the ambient mode loud clicks in the environment will make an ugly popping sound in the headphones - I don't think this is intentional, but it seems like this only happens with high frequency sounds (mine came from a multi-tool deploying and locking a tool). The ambient quality is also a bit grainy. With this is the speak-to-chat feature (deployable through the app). This works as intended and is a nice to have feature. It completely pauses the music and switches to ambient mode when it detects your voice. It might be best to have the option to quiet the music instead of completely pausing it which comes to the next point. Covering the right ear quiets the music and temporarily switches to ambient mode - this is perfection. It allows you to hold a conversation while keeping your music playing in the background. Awesome feature. The touch controls on this are finally a set of touch controls that I like. Double-tap to play/pause, swipe up/down for volume up/down, forward and back for next/previous song. Simple, easy, and intentional. The double-tap for play/pause is especially a nice touch as it negates an accidental touch as an input or adjusting your headphones as an input. Overall, these are fantastic headphones and definitely a pair that you should pick up. There is a reason for 4/5 starts, though - they can be better. While ANC is amazing, ambient isn't as good. The app has potential to make a lot of different customizations available as well. There are things to improve, but overall, a great set that is worth being on your head."
Jan1968,5,great sound,10/4/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] i recently got these headphones and i got to say these are comfortable and the sound is great and they cancel the noise and all you hear is the music and nothing else and it was easy setup to connect to my phone These are the best headphones i have ever owed keep up the great work sony
Alyssa,5,Fantastic,10/27/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are great for any loud place! Originally I bought these for the kids when we attend loud concerts or they need some silent time. The headphones do it's job, that's for sure and everything is pitch quiet. I like the slick black look and the simplicity of the design"
Missiuk,5,Amazing,10/5/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones simply put are amazing!!! The sound quality is like no other! For once I am able to make hands free calls and be heard!!!! I love the fact that if you remove them while listening the media pauses. They are very comfortable for wear for long periods of time. The only draw back about them is that the charging cables is only a few inches long.
Jbubman,4,"Very comfortable, large case",10/19/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my first pair of over the head style head phones and I'm shocked at home comfortable these are. There is slight padding at the top of the head and the ears are very nicely padded. The noise canceling is pretty impressive. To get the full ability to optimize you will have to download the app. Out of the box there is a setting that pauses your music if you start talking, the ability to turn this off is easy to do in the app. The only negative I can see is that because these headphones don't fold the case is very large. They sound great and you can dial in whatever sound mix you want in the app."
Gwen75,5,The best noise Cancelling headset,10/9/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The noise cancellation on this headphones is awesome. I tried this feature while on a plane and so far i could barely hear anything. It feels light and fits me perfectly. The battery takes awhile to drain even with the noise cancellation in use. Awesome features with high quality. I would definitely recommend Sony - WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones.
jenynyc,4,Never experienced anything like these headphones!,11/7/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are truly headphones of the future. It was handy having them pause my music whenever I slipped them off to hear something in the house, I also liked the different controls that are right on the headphones themselves. I did notice that if I wore a thick headband or tried wearing them over a hat, they would go into standby mode as it couldn't detect if I was still listening. I consider that a good thing though, this standby mode preserved battery life whenever I took them off and forgot to power them down. The design is extremely comfortable, I nearly forgot I was wearing them a few times. Not heavy at all very comfortable on the ears and sides of the head. Lastly, I have to talk about the audio quality. I felt absolutely spoiled by how good everything sounded. I found myself using them for video games as well as music and immersive content like interactive audio or ASMR. These are hands down my favorite headphones for anything audio intensive."
Elise55A,5,Best noice cancellation out there,10/9/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I'll preface this by saying I have 5 kids so noice cancellation is a passion of mine. Not only could I not hear my kids stomping around on the floor above me but I missed a delivery guy timing my bell and pounding on the door that's how excellent these are. On top of that pairing is a breeze and they work awesome for gaming as well I was hearing every single thing. Sound is crisp and clean. Was honestly shocked with the noise cancellation it by far has exceeded expectations.
mltex,5,Phenomenal!!,10/27/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Long story short: these headphones are really, really good. The sound quality is superb. As an avid music listener, I feel super spoiled when listening to my favorite songs with these--the sound is crisp and the base and treble are just right. The noise canceling is impressive as well--I live in a rather noisy urban environment, and these headphones do a fantastic job of blocking garden-variety white noise and even louder sounds like construction. The design is sleek and sophisticated, and the headphones are lightweight for the size. Overall, I adore these headphones and highly recommend this pair if you are in the market for some new ones!"
Lauren,5,AMAZING,10/6/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] these headphones are amazing! I was so excited to try them. My family and I are huge audio files, so this is very important to us. I highly recommend for those who like high quality sound!"
dreamgirl48,5,Awesome,10/7/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are awesome. They actually work unlike them other ones out there that don't work for nothing. Now I can sleep in peace without listening to my husband snore.
Jcorndog,4,Amazing Headphones,2/14/2023,"I needed sound proof headphones for work and I'm glad I bit the bullet and chose Sony. The sound is incredible, the fit is comfortable, the battery life is perfect, and the easy access functions are a dream. I only have one complaint: my greasy fingers leave marks all over the headpiece. I realize I'm a fan of hand creams and soft skin, but I am a bit disappointed how easily my fingers leave grease marks. The design of the headphones are beautiful too, wouldn't change a thing except maybe the material it's made from. Something I'll consider next time"
BMCc,3,Wanted to like it but…,10/22/2022,"I bought these mainly for sure travel. So the ANC and comfort were really important. Neither were s expected. The head band became uncomfortable an hour into a three hour flight and the ANC didn't worked about as well as my apple AirPod pros. Muffled the airplane noise a bit, but not to the level I expected. I have a pair of 8 year old Sonys that work better. Needs adjustable ANC. Returned the head phones to place of purchase."
Lorenzo,5,Apple fan opted for these over the AirPods Max,10/24/2023,"I'm an Apple fan, but I couldn't justify the price and weight of the AirPods Max. I used the WH-1000XM2 for many years, and the WH-1000XM5 are better in (almost) everything: great sound quality, noise cancellation, design, light weight, incredible battery life. The only downside for me compared to the older model is that they don't fold, therefore the case is very big and it's more inconvenient to travel with them."
Jose,1,Do not order from walmart,12/4/2023,"Recently ordered these headphones and Walmart delivered them to the incorrect address, when contact was made they offered no help or solutions as they claimed once delivered it is not their responsibility, i have video and picture proof of the incorrect address and still no assistance is offered, be careful with their delivery as clearly its not professional or double checked."
Korbin,5,Solid buy! Very happy.,11/1/2023,"As an Apple fanboy, it took a lot of willpower to buy these instead of the Airpod Maxes! Sony's XM5's are leading review charts for a reason. Great sound, not too heavy to wear, and transitions between audio sources (music vs. call) well. The app interface is a little wonky, but I've enjoyed the noise cancellation, ""talk to mute"" functions, etc."
Lito,5,A true successor to the XM4,8/28/2023,"I was about to go for the XM4's because of their lower price, but I decided to give this XM5 a shot. It didn't disappoint! FYI to those who don't know, the sound balance of these headphones are different when used wired or wireless. They're more neutral sounding when wired (which is how I wanted them to sound), and they're more bass oriented when wireless. I use this for sound mixing on my PC, and I used it wired most of the time. That's why the big case and the ""no-fold"" mechanism compared to that of an XM4 didn't bother me much. The noise cancellation is even way better than what I've experienced when I tried on my friend's XM4. Ambient mode is not that great, tbh. You're having like a muffled version of reality when on ambient mode. Regardless, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages."
Erica,5,Buy it!!!!,12/15/2023,I brought it as a gift for my boyfriend. He has a moving company. So I wanted to buy some nice headphones to listen to music and talk on the phone hands free. Sony has always been top of the line and still is. I highly recommend
Michelle,5,Excellent sounding headphones.,9/26/2023,"The sound quality is excellent. The ability to change the sound to your liking with their equalizer is fantastic. To pause, turn down or up the volume with tapping the earpiece is wonderful."
Steve,5,These > Bose,6/13/2023,"Took these and the Bose 700 noise cancelling headphones for a test drive. Definitely prefer these. The Sony noise cancelling is a notch better and the bass is a notch deeper, which matters to me since I listen to mainly electronic music. They also charge very fast. My USB-C power meter measured 15W, which is as fast as a mobile phone."
JimboInEwa,5,Wow !,6/28/2023,"What a short review title, but that really says it all. It was between Sony and another competitor, and I'm very happy I listened to my friend's opinions as opposed to some online PAID reviewers. I DO NOT get paid or any type of compensation, so this is honest and unbiased. Been doing a lot of air travel lately, and these really make those 8+ hour flights zoom by, and when not enjoying my music the noise cancellation is JUST that. Not sound-dampening, but “how did I get the screaming baby behind me so I'm gonna take a nap now” Noise Cancellation !! So well worth the money - why didn't I do this sooner ? Thank You"
Victor,5,Enjoyable Headphones,3/15/2024,Superlative sound and convenient features for using these headphones in varied environments.
Gerard0312,5,Excellent Headphones!,1/22/2024,"I do notice that these headphones make the music more ""live"" so to speak. The head tracking works very well and is rather seemless with head turning."
Oscar350,3,Sounds great but,11/29/2023,Great sounding headphones but not the greatest for working out. Headphones get very warm and your ears sweat
Steve44Bd,5,Exceptional capabilities,7/5/2023,The ability to mute with your right hand or simply by speaking is really helpful. I also like skipping songs by forward swiping. Sound quality is leader in the industry.
Cigar guy,5,Fabulous headphones,7/12/2023,"Bought these for a trip to Alaska, preformed superbly. Great battery life and sound. Case kept everything easy to store in my carry on and protected them. Now my wife wants them for a trip she is taking."

shalafarky,5,worth every penny,10/25/2022,"Have used for about a month - love the sound, love the fit, and love the user experience. Take a bit of practice to learn the controls, but so well designed! Especially love the quick attention mode - I put my hand over the right ear cup and music pauses and noise cancellation stops... until you remove your hand."
TiRB,5,Awesome Headphones,10/18/2022,"I purchased a month ago to replace another brand of headphones as I prepared for a business trip to Europe. These are comfortable to wear for many hours, audio is excellent, easy to use and customize via the app. They block out sound very well, the case they are packed in is a bit bigger then previous headphones I have used"

jtgowen77,5,Love these headphones!!!,10/27/2022,"I bought these a month ago and they are without a doubt the best headphones that I have ever owned!! From the sleek look to the cushion ear pieces, these are just great. The quick charge feature is awesome for when I forget to charge it. Only a few minutes gets you to 50% charge or more. The noise canceling is top notch. I can not recommend this enough!! Thank you Sony!!"
Clutch 55,5,Absolutely Excellent,8/31/2022,"The XM5’s are the best headphones I’ve tried for full sound and tunability. Highs are just right, miss are smooth, and the bass is taught and full. Very comfortable to wear also. Previously demoed the air max phones and I choose the XM5’s. Fully satisfied with this product."
conway1308,5,You get what you pay for. I love them.,10/19/2022,"My first real pair of headphones. I bought them for ANC, and I am not disappointed. The implementation of ambient and anc mode switching automatically is surprisingly useful. I didn't think I'd use it, but it's good. My burps activate speak to talk and my soft speech isn't always picked up, but it's still quite good. It works well with my PC with a Bluetooth adapter. Ultimately I hope they last me a long time."
Emmanuelle1000,5,Best Headphones Ever,11/9/2022,I got these a few weeks ago and I love them. I wish everything I own was this good! PROs These fit well. I often wear them for hours at a time with no fatigue at all. The ANC is the best! I can have the noisy blender on in front of me and it doesn't bother me at all. The quality of the music is excellent. The quality of the microphones for phone calls is great. And the battery lasts so long you only have to charge it once a week or so. CONs For some reason I had problems pairing them up with the phone. They were solved without having to resort to CS.
sammyfly,3,"Great sound quality, painful for head",6/9/2023,"I really appreciate the sound quality on these! Unfortunately, the headband starts hurting the top of my head after just one 30-minute meeting. I'm hoping the wider band on the XM4s will be less painful. Also, the ear covers hang too low on my head so they're more on my jaw and neck than my ears."
Jeepfein,4,Great noise cancelling. Sound is muddy!,9/23/2022,"Love the noise cancelling. Best by far. The sound is muddy out-of-the-box, but the eq helps. Very comfortable. Almost forgot they were on my head. The padding could be better on the ear cups however."
Bdb01,5,Slept thru an apartment fire alarm.,9/15/2022,"The ANC is phenomenal, I use these daily for 14+ hours. The mic is crystal clear for meetings. These feel like they were made for for flying. Sound quality is amazing, bass is clear, but does not drown other elements."
JonL1,3,Not as good as the XM4s,9/13/2022,"I found these headphones to be uncomfortable to wear for more than 45 minutes. I thought the XM4s were wearable for several hours. But for comfort, sound and noise cancellation, I prefer the AirPod Max headphones. I returned the XM5s."
JeLo74,5,Best purchase I have made in years.,6/12/2022,I couldn't be happier with the build and sound quality of these headphones. I had reservations about spending that much on headphones but my post purchase regrets went away upon first use. Sony just earned another loyal customer.
KillerCorgi89,5,Awesome Headphones!,2/15/2024,"OK, so I just got them, and only have about 2 hours of use so far, but the sound stage, and noise isolation on these are amazing. Great headphones, I am not an Audiophile by any means, but I am very pleased."
Kloud6,5,Amazing!,10/13/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones have exceeded my expectations! These are light and comfortable. Easy to set up by Bluetooth or plugging in. They charge quickly and work so well that my husband had trouble using them to talk to clients because it was weird hearing himself. I did accidentally hit the subtle buttons a few times and the matte finish show fingerprints easier then I'd like but over these are amazing! My mom's begging to use them on her overseas trip.
smith72,5,"Great Features, but...",7/7/2022,It's a little small for my head and it causes pain on my head where the top part rests on it after an hour or two
qirqs,5,Amazing sound quality,6/13/2022,The sound quality is amazing & these headphones have to be one of the most comfortable headphones i’ve ever tried.
GregCott,5,A great set of headphones,6/10/2022,I love these. I own the Bose 700 and the Airpods Max. These are better. Lighter. Better sounding. Easier to wear longer.
Pablo the Npc,5,Got 2 for me and a birthday present for a friend,4/6/2023,"I bought the black one back in March and I absolutely loved it. I have the Bose 700 for 2 years but starting to wear down. The Xm5 was the best replacement however one main problem is that it get dirty very easily; fingerprints and sweat. But that just the blacks one. I just ordered the sliver for a birthday present for my friend, I know she will love it."
Chris32,5,Best headphones I have tried,8/22/2022,I bought them since release date are an amazing pair of headphones.
Aaron s,5,The best!!,10/18/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Hands down the best headphones I have ever used. I will never buy a different pair of noise canceling headphones. They are comfortable on the ears and fit different shaped heads perfectly. I love the feature that allows you to talk and the music stops and after 15 secs of not talking the music continues! 10/10 recommend!
lauren97,5,Comfort meets Quality,10/7/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. They fit over your ears completely, leaving your ears pain free. I also wear glasses and find I can wear these headphones without any pinching or discomfort. The noise cancelling feature is unparalleled, truly drowning out the sound around you. My favorite feature is that they automatically pause your music/podcast/show when you take them off, and resume when you put them back on."
Courtney3636,5,I love these headphones!,10/13/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I prefer over the ear headphones compared to ear buds. These headphones are amazing! Noise cancellation is on point. The are so comfortable. They don't pull my hair when I take them off. The sound quality is wonderful. They are cordless so I can put them on when I'm doing the dishes or cleaning. I am very impressed with these headphones. Sony really makes quality products. They hold a challenge well. My husband likes them a lot and he's an ear bud person. 10/10 would recommend
Mike37:7,5,Best headphones,10/9/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are the best headphones I have ever owned and that's saying a lot, as I've owned plenty! The sound quality is phenomenal, very crisp and clear. Noise cancellation is among the best I've ever experienced. They're also very sleek and not overly bulky on your head. I would highly recommend these to anyone!"
Weswigg,5,Awesome Product,10/4/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got these wireless earphones and they are awesome I like how the ear muffs swivel and I like how well they fit. Perfect fit. The sound quality is great and the noise cancellation is great as well. Will definitely be recommending to everyone to go out and buy
michalk15,5,Awesome,10/11/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are such a great product. the sound that they produce is amazing. They cancel out all the other noise to where you just hear your music or show.
Sound25,5,Great Features with Sound Quality,10/6/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] the sound quality is fantastic. I love the touchpad options it makes it so much easier than trying to find the correct button. The sound dampening is amazing, you can't hear anything when this feature is turned on. The only thing I wish was a little better was how loud the volume can go, and the bass in the headphones. Other than that, these are the best set I have owned thus far."
SueAnne,5,Sounds Amazing,10/6/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received the Sony - WH - 1000xm5 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones and they are amazing. The sound quality is far beyond anything I have ever heard, absolutely the best!! I love that they are noise cancelling and wireless. They also came in a really nice zipper case to put them in after using them. I am so very happy with the Sony Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones. I will definitely tell friends and family how great these Headphones are."
qirqs,5,Amazing sound quality,6/13/2022,The sound quality is amazing & these headphones have to be one of the most comfortable headphones i've ever tried.
Mara,5,Good,3/21/2024,"I like them, noise canceling is good. I got white and the black. The white has a textured material which makes staining more difficult and less visible. However, the black seemed to definitely have better sound quality and more weight to it. I don't know if that was just my mind or if that is actually the case but just thought I'd mention. Definitely would recommend."
Adam,5,great condition,10/15/2023,the headphones came in great shape and my wife loved them.
Jocelyn,1,Disgusting,12/18/2023,This is a gift for someone how can I give this to someone when it's really dirty that's why apple is better.
Gabie101,4,all great but one,3/11/2024,"Everything is good, But one thing. And that every time that I close the door on any car, It bugs up and makes a high pitch noise for a solid second. Other than that, It nice and good condition from packaging"
MediaLover,5,Great Headphones,12/21/2023,"These headphones are good! They rival my Bose. I was looking for something similar but yet different. They're light, sleek looking and the sound is incredible. The noise canceling is phenomenal. I highly recommend. Owner manual made it easy to navigate new location of sound settings."
Femolala,5,Great!!!!,9/7/2022,I absolutely love it...It's the best headphones I've ever gotten.
Carlos_TL322005,5,"Great Performance Super Sound, nice and conftable.",9/19/2023,"I love it, Great sound, the noise cancelling is not the best but it will do, but the quality across the PC, is great! I do have problems to conect with the blutooth on the PC all the time."
BigDaddy72,5,Audio Bliss with Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones,4/25/2023,"The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones deliver an exceptional listening experience perfect for music enthusiasts, gamers, and travelers. Their outstanding sound quality features crisp, clear audio and a rich, deep bass that elevates every genre of music.

livesnd,5,Headphones,6/28/2023,"I am a retired live sound reinforcement engineer. These are the best sounding headphones I have ever owned. They are extremely comfortable and have notable features. You can customize your own EQ setting. The noise cancelling feature is outstanding. Swipe up or down for volume, skip tracks, pause, bass boost and the list go on. Battery life is extraordinary! I cannot think of anything that I dislike about them. I use them when I do my yardwork. I cannot hear any of my lawn tools. Lawn mower or weedeater. I look forward to doing my lawn work. LOL"
Sahil,5,10/10 headphones for the price!,7/27/2023,These headphones are amazing with there ANC and sound quality! Ive always loved the sony line of audio products and the XM5's do not disappoint! I would definitely recommend these if your going into highschool or college and have some money to splurge. Also these are great for traveling with how comfortable they are in cars and planes etc.
Stanash,4,Noise dampening could be better,6/28/2023,"While most things are better than the gen1 of this headset, there are 2 areas that are frustrating. 1) I hear more sounds. The noise canceling for what I hear is not nearly as good as my old gen 1 2) small sounds, like clearing my throat, or taliing, will cause a beep in the headphones, and a loss of sound coming in, until I press a button. This is inconsistent. Sometimes it happens, sometimes not. With that being said, the main reason of getting these was the improvments in noise canceling that OTHERS heard when on calls. This was VASTLY improved, and the main reason for 4 stars."
Erik44,5,Excellent headphones and features,6/29/2023,"I bought this about three months ago, and let me tell you, this is excellent. You can also change the noise characteristics, and it is very good. To let you know, I work in an injection, mold shop. For those of you who don't know what this is, imagine being constantly doing with Measurements over 90 dB. This is the sustained, through eight hours, a day or more. So, you have to have the best in this varmint. If you don't, you can literally get deaf."
RexDoodis,5,Great sound and noise canceling!,7/6/2023,"I have other brand bone conduction headphones for listening to podcasts and other media with just voice. However, I needed headphones with better sound for music and also excellent noise canceling. The WH1000XM5B headphones provide both superb audio quality as well as ""best in the market"" noise canceling. The noise canceling feature also allows amplified passthru of the ambient sound with a press of a button (or temporarily simply by placing a hand over the right earphone). The passthru appears to be accomplished by using microphones in both earphones to pick up the sound from each side, amplify it, and supply it to the headphones. This stereophonic design also provides the ability to hear from which direction the sound is coming from."
mark,5,Great headphones,12/31/2023,"I like these headphones, sound quality is great. The noise cancellation is the best compared to other ones I've tried"
MoMoEsq,5,Sony is the best!,9/19/2023,"I have owned Bose, Sennheiser and obviously Sony. Sony stands out in terms of performance as well as price."

Runner123,5,Amazing,10/5/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am in love with Sony's headphones! These are nothing but exceptional! They came in a case box that is perfect for storing when not in use. And it's easy to store. The blue tooth paring capability is perfection. I was and continue to be able to pair once my bluetooth is on and the headphones are on. It is easy for me to also pair with my peloton and connects seamlessly. Now the noise…stunning! I cannot hear anything around me while I am working, working out or just listening. Perfect when I want to tune out my world and enter another one. They also fit comfortably over my ears and stay put! They are super light weight which I also love! These are better quality than the other leading brands and I will continue to buy this brand! Absolutely in love with these! I can't say it enough."
Mullins,5,Great,10/4/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am so glad I got these Sony - WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones. They are amazing. They were so easy to set up. They are very comfortable to wear. They came in a great case to keep them safe. The noise cancellation works so well too. And the sound quality is top notch. These are the best headphones I have ever used. Definitely my new favorite.
Anonymously Sarah,5,Really nice sound and holds a long charge,10/12/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a really nice set of headphones! They feel really nice on my ears and the headband part is easily adjusted. Over time, the headband does start to get sore on my head and I have to adjust it, but this has been the case with all of my headphones. I have a smaller head and they aren't tight enough on my ears to just stay put without the support of the headband. The sound is very nice, with surround sound so that both ears hear different sounds and background noises. The noise-canceling is very good also, although I haven't had the opportunity to give them the ultimate test yet: airplane ride. They definitely cut out any noise around my house and in public. The charge lasts a very long time! I've used them a whole day without them dying. The travel case is very nice and compact, with a little compartment for the cords. It came with a short charging cord and a wired stereo cord but no charging block, which seems to be standard now. One of the really cool features is that it pauses when you lift one ear off your head. So if someone makes a quick comment where you need to hear but not fully remove them, just lift, listen and then put it back down on your ear without missing what you're listening to (I do a lot of audio books). Overall, I'm very happy with these; they're definitely the best headphones I've had!"
David,5,Bought two,11/19/2023,"Fast and easy with no issues, got in 3 days."
masterloggie,5,Great sound and ANC,9/3/2023,Had the headphones for 3 weeks now. Ultra HD with ATMOS is a tantalizing experience.
THANGAMUTHU,1,I did not like the product. The mic quality is bad,10/26/2023,I did not like the product. The mic quality is bad
Chuck,5,Great price.,10/25/2023,"Quick delivery, at a great price."
Shop,4,Good quality. Expensive.,9/27/2023,The noise cancelling works great
Kit Arashi,4,"Great , but comes at a cost",6/29/2022,"I've been looking forward to this product for a while and have had the mx series since mx3s, the line has comes cone a long way but the portability is now kinda a second thought of the device with foldability now isn't an option and the case is a bit bulky compared to its former models. anc is so much better with the upgrade of mics bing 6 instead of 4. and the sound is still amazing as always with the deeper bass then the bose sets that are similar."
Jcorndog,4,Amazing Headphones,2/14/2023,"I needed sound proof headphones for work and I’m glad I bit the bullet and chose Sony. The sound is incredible, the fit is comfortable, the battery life is perfect, and the easy access functions are a dream. I only have one complaint: my greasy fingers leave marks all over the headpiece. I realize I’m a fan of hand creams and soft skin, but I am a bit disappointed how easily my fingers leave grease marks. The design of the headphones are beautiful too, wouldn’t change a thing except maybe the material it’s made from. Something I’ll consider next time"
Palto,5,Awesome,6/11/2022,These headphones blow the AirPod Max headphones out of the water. They’re more comfortable and lighter than the last Sonys in this line-up. They also fixed the connectivity issue where it’s a breeze to connect to a different device. Highly recommended and worth the price.
Zenozmos,4,"Great, but not refined",10/9/2022,"Pros: 1) very light and I can barely feel them 2) sublime sound via analog 3.5mm cord 3) sound cancellation system works pretty well 4) genious buttonless control sensors built in the right headphone 5) good quality of voice recording while speaking on the phone Downsides: 1) sound quality sucks when connected via bluetooth 2) sound is distorted BADLY when there are any microwaves around (when I warmed up some food, my music was randomly sped up for the time when the microwave oven was working) and probably some other active BT devices around 3) the control sensors doesn't work when connected via analog, they play click sounds when I touch the pad, but nothing happens 4) noise cancellation system created ""kick"" sounds when I was travelling in a car at high speed with windows open 5) covers are not deep enough, my ears sometimes hit against the speaker when I open my jaw, which creates a distracting rubbing sound All in all I am pretty satisfied since I got what I was looking for: decent headphones with REALLY decent sound I haven't heard for years which are able to cut me off from pretty much any other sound of the reality around. I was expecting for some low grade behaviour from BT cos they always suck in general, so no surprise there. Sensor control pad is great but must be reworked to be functional at all times. Ear covers could be enlarged too by 20-30%. The rest is as usual - a bit overpriced, a bit glitchy, but does the required job - the Sony style."
Anon,5,"",6/12/2023,The operating instructions are still a mystery to me.
WJS2,5,Work and sound great,10/19/2022,"I compared these headphones to the Apple AirPods Max, and the Sennheiser Momenthum 4 wireless headphones. After several days of evaluating the sound and features i selected the Sony's because I felt the sound quality was the best."
Taylor13t,5,Great sounds,12/4/2022,Have it wireless to my phone to my TV so I can listen even to my game system on the headphones everything sounds so great can’t hear anything going on around me on the outside .I love them.
Jake1996,5,Amazing headphones,6/21/2022,I love these headphone! They are comfortable and sound amazing! I already told my friend who loves listening to music as much as me to pick these up! Great headphones you won’t be disappointed!
Jythin,4,Great sound quality,6/3/2022,"I bought it and sounds good but one issue is the noise cancellation is an average and has no foldable flaps like in xm4. But, superior sound and great features for xm5."
Kylek,5,Amazing,6/3/2022,Bought this a month ago. Works great sounds great. First Sony product and I am pleased.
Tinkerchelle83,5,Noise cancelling at its finest,10/4/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony has done it again. I don't think I've ever tried one of their products and been disappointed. These noise canceling headphones provide 30 hours of playback with a quick charge time. The comfortable level is unmatched, soft leather. They have a beautiful carrying case so you can keep your headphones safe and protected. I can't say enough good things. If you are looking for quality then look no further."
Nurselynn123,5,Best Headphones I've Owned!,10/20/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am BEYOND happy with my new Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones! The sound quality is absolutely amazing. I listen to many different genres of music- from Rock, Rap, Country, EDM, and more. They all sound fantastic! It offers the perfect mix of sound! When I am not listening to music- I also watch videos and listen to lectures. As an online student, I have to wear headphones hours on end to do my homework, lectures and more. These are by far the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned. I can wear these for 8 hours straight and experience zero discomfort. My old pair of headphones would start to hurt and I would need a break- but these Sony Headphones are so comfortable that I do not have to! I also love the Noise Cancelling Feature. I am a Mom of a 5 year old and when he is playing it can be quite noisy. The Noise cancelling allows me to muffle out some of the surrounding sounds so I can still manage to focus on what I am doing. I am also impressed with the battery life! The batteries last me quite a few hours without needing a charge which is important to me when it comes to doing study sessions. I honestly do not have anything negative thing to say about these headphones."
RPG1217,5,Amazing headphones with unreal noise cancelling!!!,10/7/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got these in the mail a few days ago and i love love love these headphones! The noise cancelling is crazy, it has button so you can activate it and you cannot hear a thing! It also has other features like shortcuts to spotify and it has a touch pad so you can control the music as well as the music volume. I hope to be able to test more Sony products in the future!!!"
Mandy12,5,Comfort Meets Great Sounds,10/18/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] ﻿These Sony wireless noise-canceling headphones deliver the ultimate listening experience. I was really impressed. When I first opened the packaging, attached to the protective zipper case, there was a tag with quick-start instructions and a QR code that took me right to the help guide for the headphones so everything I needed to start using them was at my fingertips. Thank you, Sony. The collapsible protective case that the headphones come in has a place for everything to be kept - cords and headphones. The headphones are extremely comfortable on my ears. Usually, my ears are easily irritated by headphones so I opt for an earbud, but these work well for me. Not only is the sound great for listening to music or movies (I travel a lot so I'm often listening on a train or airplane), but you can make calls as well. They also offer a long-lasting 30-hour battery life paired with quick charging. In just 3 minutes of charging I can get 3 hours' worth of battery life which comes in handy when on the go. I am extremely happy with these wireless headphones. They offer quality sound without sacrificing comfort. Great product!"
Cherylz,5,The Best Sound Quality,10/11/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was looking for a new headphones when I came across these. Sony has delivered a remarkable product that stands up to the competition out there. I couldn't wait to see how good they are and I wasn't disappointed. They are so lightweight and comfortable that I forgot I had them on. The sound quality is superb. It comes with a nice case to transport them, which comes in handy since they are bulky. Wished it would be foldable for easy storage or to carry around."
PeteofNEPA,5,The best,10/5/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are amazing in every way. Amazing low end mids and crystal clear highs. I would highly recommend to anyone. There by far the best headphones I have ever used. Great quality
Cpm19,4,Work great,10/12/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones work just as they should. They are clearly noise canceling as you can't hear anything from the outside of them. The sound is phenomenal. They are comfortable as well.
Clutch 55,5,Absolutely Excellent,8/31/2022,"The XM5's are the best headphones I've tried for full sound and tunability. Highs are just right, miss are smooth, and the bass is taught and full. Very comfortable to wear also. Previously demoed the air max phones and I choose the XM5's. Fully satisfied with this product."

Nikhil,1,"",12/3/2023,Box itself look old product .Didn't liked it
Amanda,1,Terrible experience- DO NOT BUY FROM SELLER,1/27/2024,"0 stars!!! I accidentally purchased this item, going through the checkout process I selected “PayPal” as my method of payment, I figured I would be redirected to the PayPal website as I usually am, nope! Not this time! I was checked out completely. So I immediately contacted the seller to cancel the order and requested cancellation through the app, however, that never happened. I never heard back from the seller either. As soon as I received the product a few days later, I immediately initiated a return and was given a return label from the seller thru Walmart.com. I dropped the package off at a FedEx drop box as directed. The package has never been scanned and I have not received my money back! Over $300 by the way! I have contacted Walmart, FedEx, the seller, you name it! FedEx said the tracking number I was given is not a valid tracking number, therefore it couldn't have been scanned. Walmart is telling me over and over again to contact FedEx! However, Walmart needs to investigate this seller, they are committing fraud and stealing peoples money, like mine! Do not buy from this seller, you will regret it!"
GD,5,Near perfect ANCs,12/9/2023,"Amazing construction, noise, cancelling features and comfort. Use it for work and leisure. The only fly is that the design doesn't allow you to fold it and when you hang it on your next, the air phones are inverted. But otherwise the best sound quality, and function."
VladimirM,4,"Great Headphones, But Hurt My Ears Helixes Badly",8/13/2023,"Absolutely the best quality headphones I ever tried if not for the fact I cannot use them of more than a couple hours at a time. The helix pain becomes unbearable. Called support, they stated no solution from Sony is available. Bought a third-party earopads replacements, but still struggling with the replacement process."
Eve67,3,Noise canceling ain't it,10/15/2023,"I bought my first pair a month or so ago and the noise canceling wasn't good at all, noise kept being filtered in. I couldn't even notice any difference from the noise canceling setting and the ambient setting. They both sounded exactly the same with the outside world being loud. Got them replaced with a newer pair through customer service but they both have the same issue, I'm guessing all of them are like this at this point. They are really comfortable tho at least."
Anon,4,Undoubtedly elevate your auditory experience.,8/22/2023,"The WH-1000XM5 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Canceling Headphones in Midnight Blue are truly exceptional. Their noise-canceling capabilities are nothing short of remarkable, providing an immersive listening experience by blocking out unwanted ambient sounds. The sleek midnight blue color adds a touch of elegance to the design, making them a stylish accessory as well. The sound quality is unparalleled, delivering rich and crisp audio across various genres. Comfort is another strong suit, as these headphones are designed for extended wear without causing discomfort. With intuitive touch controls and seamless connectivity, these headphones are a perfect companion for both work and leisure. Whether you're on a long flight, working in a noisy environment, or simply enjoying your favorite tunes, the WH-1000XM5 headphones will undoubtedly elevate your auditory experience."
Tommy H,5,The Best of The Best,7/29/2023,"I bought these strictly for noise cancelling as my new mower is so loud that my older Sony's couldn't cut it. I was amazed at how effective these are for noise cancellation, and was also very impressed at the clarity of the sound when taking a phone call or listening to music. Pricey? Yes, but I value my hearing above a cheap knockoff."
LJCLARY,5,Headphones 1000,6/28/2023,"Had these quality headphones for about 6 months, the sound is amazing, controls are easy to understand. Connection to Bluetooth source is strong and sound quality for rock, jazz, new age and classical is outstanding. I highly recommend this product."
Cesar,5,Really good!,12/22/2023,Absolutely love the headphones they are just a league of its own the noise cancellation is no joke and so comfortable for long durations.

Wendy,5,Awesome quality,12/29/2023,Mine weren't damaged or anything. I love the quality too
Julie22,5,Great sound quality/best noise canceling hdphones,10/7/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was excited to start using Sony's WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones. I am currently typing this review while wearing the headphones! First of all, the headphones are stored in a sleek carrying case. There is a pocket for the headphone wired jack/cable and charger cable (very short cable?). Beautiful case, but bigger than previous model as this model's headphones do not fold up? Sound is AWESOME. Noise cancelling feature is FANTASTIC.I cannot hear much outside noise when I have these headphones on. Earpads are very very soft and comfortable. Hope the material on the earpads last after prolonged usage. Headband hurts a bit at the top of my head as it weighs down a bit, but that can be just me - I have a sensitive head. Overall, a snug fit -- not too tight. Learning curve was a bit tougher as I am older - but my son had the headphones up and running and playing around with its features in 15 seconds flat!!!! Meanwhile, I had to download Sony's headphone software onto my iPhone. Do that as there are instructions in the app. Plus, you can set it up to link to Spotify, etc. and use the touch controls - for example, swiping up on the right headphone raises the volume, swiping down decreases volume, double tab pauses the music, forward swipe forwards to next song, taking off headphones shuts off power, etc. These touch features are really snazzy when working correctly, but then I've experienced glitchiness as well. Lots of other features on the app you can play with and customize to your liking. I like the fast charging of battery and LONG battery life - big plus for me. DEFINITELY WILL COME IN HANDY TO NOT ALWAYS BE WORRYING ABOUT CHARGING HEADPHONES! I foresee myself using this pair of headphones quite often!"
Cher12,5,Blocks Noise & Plays Favorite Music,10/12/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love the Sony noise canceling headphones. They block out noise very well. I love that it has built-in Alexa and I can listen to my favorite music anytime. I never miss a phone call or notification because it will let you know when you have notifications. The built-in Alexa allows you to call someone whenever by simply asking. They fit so comfortably that you could wear them all day if you wish. The cushions are thick and fit snugly around the ears to block unwanted noise. Set up was very simple with easy to follow instructions by scanning the QR code provided. Very well constructed with obvious comfort and convenience in mind. They will come in very handy for us because our back yard is an interstate highway just beginning construction. My husband loves them too and is planning on using them when mowing and weed eating the lawn. They will come in handy when using his chainsaw to trim the many trees in the yard. They will work great for the woodwork he does too. I'm happy they will protect his hearing while working with loud tools and machinery. I will enjoy them while gardening or anytime. I can play music while working around the house without waking my husband when he's working nights. It makes me a happier person while listening to my favorite music. It's so easy by simply asking it to play what I'm in the mood to hear. Sound quality is great. I would recommend the Sony noise canceling headphones because you can listen to your favorite music and never miss a notification or phone call and it blocks out loud noise. It makes life much more enjoyable while protecting your hearing.

Double A,5,Crystal clear sound,6/28/2023,I've had them for a few months and they are the best sounding……as close to professional ear monitors as I've ever heard.
Philip,2,Totally inaccurate info from seller.,7/6/2023,quality is great but the battery is probably only 25 - 30% they die really fast and charge to 100% in an hour or so.
Elton Almeida,3,Sounds great & light weight,6/14/2022,The sound quality of these headphones is awesome. However I was disappointed with the build quantity and size. I wish the top part of the headband was made of plastic while the bottom leather. I felt the headphones protrude a little too much and looked too big for my head. Would be great if Sony can get that great sound in a smaller form factor.
Vicente,3,nice and light on the head but needs improvements,1/30/2023,"Really good sound, but as far as comfortability, it doesn't do too well with keeping cool. It's very insulated, causing the ears to overheat, and then sweat, and it says on the instructions not to sweat with them. I think it's blue hockey. I'm gonna do it no matter what but they sound amazing."
jjhelfman,4,Very high quality,6/14/2022,"I am really enjoying the great sound quality and noise-canceling capabilities of this product. One feature I think could be improved is the performance of the Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) button. Sometimes, I have to press it multiple times before it turns on/off and it would be useful to have a clear indicator for ANC status (on/off) - either a voice or light."

Angelica85,5,Excellent sound,10/5/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got the Sony - WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones and they work wonders so easy to use and set up. These are the best headphones I have used in a long time I would definitely recommend
Zari45,5,Excellent Quality!,10/9/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Sony Wireless Headphones were even better than I expected. The sound quality is great and the noise canceling feature is one of the best I've used. They auto adjust to fit your environmental noise and can be optimized for your particular ear shape to give the best sound experience. I would highly recommend these headphones.
Anon,5,Wireless headphones,10/4/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Recently received this product a few days ago and I down right need this masterpiece these headphones are perfect sound quality all around output of this is amazing it wrks it definitely a great asset because I wrk out a lot as well bt these are perfect definitely recommend this product to family and friends
Cortney0202,5,Amazing Sound,10/9/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my first time using a noise canceling head set and I'm very impressed. The quality of sound is amazing. I absolutely like that it detects if you take the head set off your ears that it pauses what you're listening to. The battery lasts up to 30 hours, which is great. It is very easy to set up the app to your phone and it is not hard to use. It fits nicely over my ears and its comfortable. The only issue I have is the suction over my ears. My ears ended up having a little discomfort and had a slight headache, but that just can be that I could have sensitive ears. I am very happy with this product and would recommend to anyone."
Mommaof2,5,Incredible head phones,10/4/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These head phones are incredible but first the packaging is sooo aesthetically amazing so well thought out and visually pleasing and the case is pristine . The noise canceling is phenomenal as well. The sound quality is out of this world and I love how when you take them off the music pauses till you put them back on these are definitely a must have
Tiny151,5,"Great pair of headphones, almost perfect",10/15/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Pros -Headphones feel higher quality. It is still made of plastic but the smooth matte finish and feel generally seems higher quality than other headphones that I have in this price range such as the Jabra evolve 2 75. - Setup was really easy using the ""HeadPhones"" app on android. - Ability to wear headphones while lying on bed. One of the things that I'm unable to do with other headphones is being able to lie back on my bed without the headphones bothering me. These Sony headphones have a angle in such a way that they do not get in the way. - ANC is very good. I have a 1 year old and have the white noise machine on all the time. The ANC works really well at muting ambient sounds on. The ability to choose how much ambient noise comes through is also great. - Some nice quality of life features such as speak to cancel ANC, and also cutting the right ear. - The memory foam around the ear really helps with comforts. Putting on for hours does not hurt. - Sound quality is very good. - Battery life does not drain quickly. Leaving a fully charged headphone around for 2 days, I still saw 99% battery life after starting to use it again. Cons - Microphone quality is poor compared to Jabra which have a boom mic that comes out. Speaking on the phone, my spouse thinks it not as good quality as speaking directly into phone but better than being on speaker phone. - Not waterproof or sweat resistant. This means that they cannot be used outside while raining or during exercising. - A full charge can take a couple of hours. There really should be quicker ways to charge this given the current climate with fast charging phones."
GeorgieH,5,Total Game Changer for my Music!!,10/4/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are totally amazing and it completely changes the way I listen to my music! Clarity and awesome sound, I love them! Easy to use and hook up through Bluetooth, comes with everything you will need to hook into your music experience! Highly recommend to others to get and use for oneself or loved ones!"
Matty209,5,Incredible Sound Quality,10/1/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are amazing. The sound quality they produce is astonishing. I replace my earbuds with these and realized very quickly that i was missing out! They are very comfortable on your ears and will fit on your head perfectly. They charge fast and hold that charge for days if not weeks. Noise canceling is a huge plus and works splendidly. Highly recommend.
Sonu,5,Super quality music,10/5/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am lobing my new Sony Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones. They came in great packaging, are easy t set up and use and the music quality is excellent. I love listening to music on and on and I also use it to watch movies on my laptop. I highly recommend it as a great buy!"
Bobert67,5,Audio perfection,10/7/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Not only does the noice cancellation work incredibly well, but the audio fidelity is unmatched. I can't recommend these headphones enough to those looking for new one. They're incredibly comfortable and you'd forget you're wearing them if it wasn't for the audio coming through them."
NJsunshine,5,Great sound quality,10/11/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I tried Sony-WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones. These are by far the best set of headphones that I've ever used. The sound quality is amazing. I listen to mostly hard rock and heavy metal music and with these phones you can hear everything that's happening. They are comfortable and have excellent range. I wear while doing housework and receive reception throughout the entire house.
FelAnnRod,5,Great Product,10/15/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony's WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones are amazing. The sound is crisp and clear. I love these headphones !!
Bones,5,same as the Sony WH-1000XM4,11/15/2023,Works great.. they are almost exactly the same as the Sony WH-1000XM4 just a little different design.. but the sound quality is the same...
DayG,5,Great Bluetooth headphones with wired capabilities,2/29/2024,"These headphones are very comfortable, have really great sound, and the noise-cancelling is awesome once it starts. It takes a couple of seconds for the headphones to analyze the ambient noise, but once it starts its noise cancellation it does a really good job. The app is pretty intuitive, although I'm unsure how much the ear analysis does. I've yet to experience the directional sound. I upgraded my nugs.net just to try this feature, but either they have not yet encoded the music to make use of the technology, or the technology simply doesn't work. But in all honesty these are stilll great headphones."
Rocco P,3,"Great sound and battery, until it broke",1/25/2023,"These headphones are outstanding for sound, noise cancelling, and battery life. Unlike all previous headphones I have owned, these cannot be used while charging. This can be a little annoying if the battery dies when I have 10 minutes left in a movie. Fortunately, they charge very quickly. It is disappointing that the app only works on a cell phone. I use these primarily with my computers and TV, so I cannot take advantage of all the features that might be available through a phone. The build quality is rather flimsy. The padding on the headband started peeling off at 2 months, and the right unit snapped off at 3 months (today), making them useless. As one of the most expensive headsets in this category, I expected something a little more sturdy. I will contact Sony about this tomorrow to see if they stand behind their products, and then I will revise my review as needed."
Hanish,5,Very good,2/13/2024,"Loved it, it's really good quality and it has all the features but one problem is that if you want to use the headphones via the audio jack the sound quality levels down from like 10 to 0.5, it's like listening to a 25 dollar headphones, besides that the actual quality of music when we switch it on and use is awesome. Don't forget to connect it to the app it gives you most of the listening styles and quality variations."
FeliciaH,5,Have a number of useful features that work for me,1/16/2024,"I like these a lot. They fit my needs. They sound good. Connect with my devices. Have an app that I can customize settings. Are comfortable. Have a number of useful features that work for me like the different levels of pass through sound. I use these daily on walks, at work, or just around the house. If I could have one feature it would be for the cup to rotate down instead of up when around my neck. All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase."
IDEFIBU360,5,Sound Sound and more sound,8/14/2023,I purchased these for my birthday. After reading tons of reviews on the higher end phones I kept coming back to these. They did not disappoint. Fabulous sound incredibly comfortable. These are easily comparable to the Apple top of the line phones which I purchased for my son.
Seth,5,The Best Headphones Money Can Buy!,8/7/2023,"These are the BEST noise canceling headphones on the market HANDS DOWN. The sound quality is super clean and I like how it has an app that allows you to tinker with the EQ settings to really get the sound you want. Hardcore audiophiles will probably have nitpicks, but for the average consumer, these are pretty much the best headphones that money can buy!"
Robert T,4,Sony WH1000XM5 paired with Sony Xperia 1 V,9/5/2023,I have owned this headset for about a year I use it with my Sony Xperia 1 V for music. I like this headset because it is light has great sound quality the software control is good accept the 360 thing. I have tried to set it up several times just can't get through the process so lost a star.
Chris,5,Best headphones ever!!,1/1/2024,The audio is the best I've ever heard. I also bought Bose 700 and it wasn't even close audio wise. They also are very comfortable and you don't really even feel them on your head. You can't beat for the price and quality.
Anon,3,Amazing headphones but construction needs improvem,2/18/2024,I bought these and by far the most amazing headphones I've ever had but the construction is bad they broke after just 2 months of owning it
Bash1979,5,Best noise cancelling headphone,9/13/2023,I've owned several noise cancelling headphones and earbuds from Bose to beats to AirPods or and so on. So far I'm really impressed with the sound quality and noise cancellation on this headphone. Thank you Sony. Keep up the good work.
Marie E,5,AMAZING SOUND!!!,9/6/2023,I bought these headphones about 3 weeks ago and have used them almost daily. The quality is 100%! The fit is comfortable and the battery life is great.
jlacen19,2,Very bad engineered,11/18/2023,Extremely bad engineered. Very cheap build even though they cost 300 plus! Everyone has the same problem with the swivel popped out ! Another thing is very bad instructions for finding the serial number and model number.
Gee Dub,5,WH -1000XM5 headphones,7/28/2023,Based on positive reviews I bought a pair of these rather than my usual Bose —- man these thins are super - if you love hearing all the instr and intricacies in the music you will love the audio !! My single complaint is I can't turn noise canceling up and Dow between 1-10 ( a feature I use constantly with my Bose )
Earlf,5,Sonys headphones,7/30/2023,I thought I was nuts for spending so much money on headphones I was so close to returning them. They are worth every penny. They're absolutely incredible headphones. The sound is incredible. With the Sony app you can fine tune the sound the way you like it. You just float away listening to the music.
Jay,5,Love these.,1/8/2024,Excellent headphones. Love the way it pairs with multiple devices and the touch responsiveness of the device.
Joseiliz,5,Amazing purchase,2/26/2024,"Headphones came really well packaged, and it was shipped very quickly, got them in two days. 10/10"
Alfredo,5,Excellent Headphones,10/22/2023,"The best sound, noise canceling and bass performances among other features. Download the Sony app for more control and better sound."
ChefJeff,5,Unbelievable,10/13/2023,Great Sound Great noise cancelling Most comfortable headphones ever
KBJ3,5,Superb,8/27/2023,So far so good got no complaints complaints excellent sound quality very good built
Crow92,1,Broke after a week,10/5/2022,Bought these bc the internet said they were the best.. and they were.. for a week. Left ear started having a constant loud crackling noise. Barely used them.. super bummed. Going to hopefully return them for a full refund.
Alphamalemaverick5,5,Makes me transcend time and space,6/29/2022,I feel like Dr. Manhattan when I’m wearing these. Out of body experience every time they come in contact with my ears. (Use the app and look up the best EQ for the XM5 and then adjust from that for best sound quality). Battery is nigh eternal. Powered by Zeus himself.
mcheng916,5,Excellent headphone with noise cancelling,12/5/2022,"Bought it for a couple months and have been really impressed about it so far. Really love the sound, The noise cancelling is good even on a flight The mic is good for con-call too The only downside is that the container is big and harder for carrying around. And my ears get hot after a couple hours of wearing."
And8,3,Too many features and distractions,11/9/2022,"It is so sophisticated it has all sort of features. After 5 years with my old Sony set, I gave it to my kiddo and I was excited about this upgrade. This has way too many useless features for my needs. I need great noise canceling for calls and work meetings, and for it to stay on and not to distract me. If you get a break, put the set down for a little bit, it turns off, as a new is battery saving feature. I had to turn it back on and ask people to wait for my set to restart and link and all that. I know you can disable that from the phone app, but then it gas ding notifications as you walk or talk or change settings, and the adaptive noise canceling turns off. It was dependent on a phone app for location and settings. Way too complicated and distracting. It is a very cool gadget, but I just need reliable headphones. I went and returned then and got the Bose you turn on and off."
Xopi,5,Goodbye world!,10/6/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've tried several noise cancelling headphones and I have finally discovered headphones that meet my standards!! The Sony wireless noise cancelling headphones are perfection. Perfect for when you want to focus on your work, drown out noise, awesome travel headphones. They are so comfortable to wear, it doesn't feel like you're wearing them at all. They come in a sleek carrying case."
Jeffki123,1,Huge step backward from then XM4,11/14/2022,"My wife has the older model. When she wears it, she cannot hear anything, including voices in the room. With this newer model it allows voices through. Blocking external voices is why I bought these. Huge disappointment from Sony."
Wfavero,5,"Great sounding, perfect for a bass player",2/13/2023,I love these. I play bass and use headphones to learn my parts. These have worked out perfect for me for that purpose.
AllRightNow,5,Great Headphones,1/20/2023,These are really nice headphones. The sound quality is excellent and the noise cancellation is very good.
BillyB271,5,Best Ever,9/15/2022,The headphones are the best I have ever used. The noise cancellation is exceptional
Zh28,3,"As my expectations, but not beyond it",6/13/2022,I recommend you to buy a xm4 or even xm3. It isn't worth so much money.
Attia,5,Just buy and enjoy.,1/19/2023,"Dont think, dont hesitate... just buy. Every penny is worth it."
GEGII,4,Esrbud features in an overear headphone.,2/14/2023,"The features are great, easy to use. Only issue is controls are small."
Sweetp601,5,Sony - WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headpho,10/6/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony - WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones great head set. I live listening to music and they last long.
Mike headphone,5,Awesome Headphones!,10/28/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are great headphones. You have to download an app to use them but after that its smooth sailing. The headphones automatically connect to my phone when I put them on. They keep your ears warm too--- if not a bit too warm. When talking on the phone with them, they eliminate pretty much all background noise and provides a nice experience on phone calls for both callers. The noise cancelling is awesome. It's pretty active and reduces all background noises to almost nothing. You can put your hands up on the headphone and it allows sound to travel through when you need to hear momentarily. One issue I do have is working with the app and figuring out how to use the quick features on the headphones (answering calls, next song, etc). They come with a great case too that is durable for traveling with. Overall these things rock!"
Terem13,5,Great headphones,10/3/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We did a lot of research on noise cancelling headphones and these had the best reviews, i have tried others but they were not good. These are amazing it really blocks out all the background noise. For those days that i just need to focus on work with no distractions. I highly recommend these"
Chrisarpin8912,5,"This headset makes me say, What surroundings?",10/3/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones make outside noise and distractions a thing of the past. This headset allowed me to zone in, and focus on important tasks. And when I wanted a minute to myself, I could feel the relaxation it gave me. The Sony headset has great battery life. I felt like I could use it for 30 hours or more like it says. It had great Bluetooth connect ability and good range. The headset audio was so crisp even at lower settings. I love the case it came with as well. I loved the fact I could listen to music and then answer calls with ease. This headset makes me feel like a professional without breaking the bank. I highly recommend them"
Bjj89,5,Amazing headphones,10/10/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are great. Stylish and yet very functional. They don't come with a charger but I have plenty of usb-c cords. The headphones perform very well, they have multiple modes for what you need. I mainly use the noise canceling when listening to podcasts and it feels like people are sitting right next to you."
technofile,4,Silences the noise and decent sound quality,10/10/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am really pleased with these headphones. I work in a noisy environment and they really help block out the buzz of activity and instead fill my ears with some high quality soothing tones to keep me sane. Recommended to all who want less noise from their surroundings but don't want to comprimise their audio quality.
Bevvy,5,Wow!,10/4/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are amazing!! The sound quality is top of the line, they're very comfortable, they completely block out noise allowing you to focus on only the sound coming from the headphones, the bass is amazing, and all sounds ate crystal clear! These are wonderful quality, wonderful fit, and just all around amazing!"
msmolly95,5,Love them,10/5/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Came nicely packed with charger cord and instructions in a zipper case. Had no problem connecting to my phone. And the sound is great. No outside noise interference.
Rachel,1,"",12/17/2023,"Absolute scam , came used and would not let me return to Walmart . Do not shop"
Dani OJ,4,Great,8/12/2022,I don't know where to start but to general description of this headphone is that it's great and superb. I first had the XM4 but this is way better in all things except and I repeat except the volume level is not that high to my expectations and as compared to the Apple headphones. The volume level is why I gave it a 4 star.
Blueberry333,4,Sounds amazing but battery life is not good,6/27/2022,"It seems like they die quickly, I charge them fully and they only last like 3 days. When I only listen to them a couple of hours a day. I don't think they last 80 hours at all."
Alex,5,"",3/9/2024,It doesn't come in original box but everything was in the package. I recommend an extended warranty. The headphones are amazing. Good service from the seller. It's been less than a week since I purchased. i Hope they work out.
Juan,5,Good restored headphone,2/29/2024,"I bought this restored xm5 headphone and have been using it for almost a week now. It connects well and works as expected. Very nice condition, no scratches and stains so that's good. I think it might just be a production some customer returns because he/she didn't like it. In general it is a deal. $100 cheaper from the new one, which will become used right after open box. Would recommend."
Aly,4,Pros V Cons,1/31/2024,I recently ruptured my eardrum and I was told I can't wear in ear headphone anymore. So far I really like these headphone! I live in a city and work in an office. After a few days they automatically adjust to ambient sound when walking( so I can hear things around me ) and then noise canceling at my office. They are on the larger side and don't compact for storage which I don't love but is common for the overhead style. They have a long battery life and great sound. You do need to download an app for more settings.
Anon,4,Great sound with one flaw,1/16/2024,These headphones have great sound and superb bass response. They also have excellent noise cancelling. The one major flaw is with the earpads. If I am wearing my glasses (which I do the majority of my waking hours) while listening to these headphones I get this rubbing/squeaking nose if I walking around or moving around or eating. This also happens when I use the headphones on Zoom calls whenever I talk. It's bearable for the most part but it definitely gets annoying after a while.
Chonk,5,Love the serenity.,8/3/2023,"I really love these headphones. Using them with the Tidal app, I can listen to anything I want to hear. I range through classical, jazz, folk, and rock, and it all sounds really great. And the best part is the serene world they create, wiping out the sound of landscapers, traffic, etc. I use them every day, often for hours, while I take care of whatever else I have to do. Just great."
travel guy,5,Great sound and noise cancelling,8/2/2023,"Great sound quality and features. Easy to use noise cancelling when not listening to music. Very comfortable. My only small complaint is that it is not easy for me to know when I have turned off the unit. No voice prompt to tell me that, which would be helpful. And it does not seem to go off automatically if I do not turn it off when I put it in its case. It does not fold up like other Sony units, but I am ok with that. It fits nicely in the case and not necessary to fold it, which can be a hassle. I recommend this great unit."
Bravo609,2,The 2 versions before were better,11/11/2023,"Ok. I love this brand and usually these headphones, that's why I spend so much on them. This new version, I felt like they were so good for so long that they tried to give you everything but the kitchen sink in this pair. The noise canceling is horrendous because I can walk by someone talking and they'll automatically stop. God help you if you attempt to cut grass or vacuum with them on. Even the adjustment in the app didn't help"
CA Sunshine,4,Great headphones but not perfect yet,8/22/2023,"I had these headphone for about 1 month now. Travelled by plane, did some yard work, listen to movies and used the to do chores around the house. The sound quality is pretty good and with the app, you can customize the sound level. The automatic digital equalizer does a good job to find the proper equilibrium for your ear. I wish, however, that there could be different sound settings for different application (like a receiver) so that for certain movies you could accentuate the voice to be clearer while other event, you could want more bass, etc.. Maybe with what the headphones are paired with, you could make the different automatic settings or have functions, on your headphones to change settings. The battery life seems to last a good amount of time. When you put on the headphone, a voice telling you how much % battery life could be a nice touch (or at least be optional on the app). The noise cancellation is really good in most settings. However, i did not notice that, when using my lawn more, it didn't do a good job in the noise cancellation. I was surprised by this since it is a steady sound that I would have believe the opposite sine wave could have been generated to cancel this noise, but that wasn't the case. The weed wacker had a better outcome by cancelling the sound most of the time. if I moved my head a bit, the headphone had to adjust, but it did the job. However, the lawn more, I didn't have any luck with it. The airplane was great pure quietness. One more thing. I believe that there should be more padding on the top of the headphone. During the first few times, I could feel the presence of the headphone. After a while you get used to it and it doesn't bother you anymore. But, at first, it did bother me. I believe that if it had more cushioning or a "" GEL"" type of cushion, it might be better."
Gigsound,4,Just need a little more thump,12/17/2023,"I got the headphones a month ago and was amazed by the noise reduction. I can run my lawnmower and it cuts out 90 percent of the noise, amazing. I tried some other much higher priced headphones and they didn't sound as good as the Sony headphones."
Jessica,5,Quick delivery and sturdy packaging.,1/20/2024,I use them for studying session of 8-12 hrs sometimes. The noise cancelling is such a great feature and why I purchased. I have 3 dogs and 3 kids so it was much needed. The double Bluetooth and call features are great as well.
Nestor,5,BEST HEADPHONE I EVER HAD,10/19/2023,"It has been 2 weeks i been using this m5, and the sound is awesome, and noise cancelation is almost the same as m4, but this one is more comfortable and soft. The shipping was so fast, the next day, i got them."
Klaydn,5,Love it!,8/30/2023,"First expensive pair of headphones and worth every cent, The noise cancelling is amazing, and all the extra features I didn't even know were a huge plus like double Bluetooth."
Musshu1981,5,Excellent Sony Headphones,8/14/2023,"I have them for a little while and I'm in love , the sound is amazing deep base and cristal clear trebles . They are not heavy so you can used them for hours without notice you are wearing them."
MrChips2,5,Sony 1000MX5 headphones,11/28/2023,"Had these cans for about a week now. Just really still learning how to use them. The sound quality is very good and ANC is pretty good. Really like them as they are more comfortable than buds, but sound is better on the buds."
Christien,3,Best in class but it's a low bar.,8/9/2023,Overall best in class. Best bass in class but the bass isn't phenomenal. It's not all that clear in bright in the high ends neither. Noice canceling and mic are great.
Kajayla,3,Pros and cons,6/24/2023,"Audio quality is pretty amazing. Headphones are comfortable, lightweight, and big head friendly. I was disappointed about the noise cancellation though. But I'm happy that it cancels it background noise when you're on a call and they can hear you very clear. It also automatically stops music or a video you're watching when you take the headphones off which I found pretty cool."
Purlov04,2,They are not better then the 4,6/29/2023,I wish I would have not got them I miss my 4. Noise cancellation goes out in and out all the time. They random disconnect all the time. You can't turn the touch off it clicks all night in my ear cuz I'm touching it that is so stupid why can't IT be fixed.
Pixeldeerest,1,Causes Headaches,6/28/2023,"I purchased these headphones a couple of months ago on my way home from vacation. I was so excited to have a pair of high quality headphones to listen to my favorite music for long periods of time during reading or drawing. However, I can't wear this headphones for more than 30 minutes with it causes intense pain on the top of my head from the VERY narrow headband. I've tried moving it or even adding padding, and it doesn't help."
DN93,1,Warning - Stopped working after 8 months,7/6/2023,"These headphones were great, right until they suddenly stopped working. One day it was fine, and the next day when I turned it on, there was no sound on the right side. Factory resetting and connecting to different devices didn't help, nor did charging the headphones again or using it in wired mode. This is very disappointing for such an expensive product."
Rud34sf,5,Excellent All Around Performance,6/28/2023,"The WH1000XM5B headphones have high quality sound, excellent noise cancelling capability, and long battery life. The ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth use is great for gaming with a PS5 and PSVR2 headset. Overall a very versatile headphone that performs well in a variety of uses."
Erik_Hotch,4,"Good headphones, but has a issues.",6/4/2022,"I used to have the 4th version of this headphones and bought the WH-1000xm5, but almost immediately I noticed a few minor things I don't like. First of all, great set for the headphones, other than what I'll mention, these headphones get me through my day with great noise canceling and sound quality. The fit well and are more comfort than the last version (xm4). Now, with that said, there are 2 problems that affect my work and use of these headphones around other people. 1) When I'm in close proximity of others having a conversation, the noise canceling doesn't work up to 100%. When there is speech around me, the quality of the noise canceling turns to maybe 50-60% effectiveness and doesn't actually cancel noise around me. It think I'm trying to listen to them, but I'm just trying to listen to my podcasts. 2) My headphones randomly turn off. I'll be wearing them for maybe an hour or two Andy headphone just shut down. Not seeing a reason as to why. Not the biggest issue because it has only happened twice (not replicable). Other than those two issues, really solid pair of headphones!"
Nheon1,3,Poorly Made,10/9/2023,I purchased the headphone and it worked decently but it seems to be poorly made and one of the side starting chipping out for no reason and I am not even a heavy user. The only reasonable explanation could highly likely the poor manufacturing process and materials.
JWoodBass,5,Still The Best!,2/3/2024,"XM2, XM3, XM4 and now XM5. Still the Best sounding wireless NC headphones!"
Twana,5,"Best noise cancellation ever, most comfortable",5/18/2023,These are the best headphones I've ever had in my life. They have the best noise canceling affect I've ever experienced and most comfortable wearing experience. They do not pinch my ears
KimAnne,5,Best headphones available!,10/9/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So many pros and no cons. These WH-1000XM5 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Canceling Headphones are great. So easy to use and par. The sound quality is top notch and the noise cancelling is amazing. So lightweight and very comfortable too. These headphones are the best ones we've found.
Arlette22,5,Top of the line!,10/21/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphones are awesome. I'm a satisfied costumer. These block out all the unwanted background noise, especially my fan. The battery life is amazing to. The fit is perfect and comfortable. Great for traveling with hours on top of hours of play and talk time. You can't go wrong with this purchase."
H2ODogz,5,Feature rich and sound as great as they feel!,10/5/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After extensive use I can confidently say that Sony's new WH-1000XM5 headphones are a tremendous leap forward from previous models and the competition.  The headphones themselves feel very sturdy and will not break from minor contact or pressure.  A big improvement from previous models is that these fold flat into their case in a very intuitive and natural manner, whereas older models I experienced required some twisting and I worried each time about exerting too much pressure and causing a break.  The weight seems much improved and even after hours of use I don't experience any pressure points or fatigue on my head or ears.  My absolute favorite part of the WH-1000XM5 is the noise cancellation, which is superior.  The cancellation is adaptive and filters the majority of ambient or ancillary sounds without the need to run optimization.  For example, other brands I have used may filter the din of traffic and sidewalk sounds but when an ambulance zooms by its siren penetrates the level of active noise cancelling in place causing a startling intrusion of loud sound.  The WH-1000XM5 manages such abrupt changes in ambient sound perfectly and optimizes with immediate recalibration to the active filtration.  I have truly not experienced this level smart adjustment on any other brand or model except for Apple's top model.  An additional feature that I absolutely love is that the headphones intelligently perceive when they have been removed and pause playback; and when put back on, playback resumes (perfect if responding to a quick question, waiter, etc.).  All of these features combine together to make the WH-1000XM5 my essential traveling companion.  As for sound quality, the WH-1000XM5 is impressive and consistent.  Bass is deep and strong, but not overbearing and never prone to distort.  Highs are crisp but not intrusive – I feel that they were likely tuned with a perfectly flat response, then a slight bass boost applied.  The result is perfect for my listening experience and I never EQ the sound playback that they receive.  In summary, I highly recommend the WH-1000XM5 and am confident that others will be as impressed with the features as I continue to be. "
joshv,5,Amazing product - much better than XM4,6/20/2022,"I accidentally broke 2 pairs of the XM4's but with the build quality of the XM5, I feel safer taking this on and off without breaking the metal/plastic band holding the headphones together. Sound quality is on another level but noice canceling could be a bit better compared to the Air Pods Max."
XXDJDLXx,5,Great,10/9/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love these they have such great sound. I love the app that you download and makes it so easy to use. The controls are so easy to use on the side of the head set.
Hill79,1,left side has gone off,10/24/2022,"the left side headphone just went off without any warning or physical damage. I can hear external voices which is the main reason why i bought it, noise cancellation."
Jerome2001,4,First pair,7/8/2022,"Bought this about a month ago and I've found it amazing! The noise cancel feature is a real help when I'm taking the train home or I just need to focus in the library. Being able to mess with the bass and treble is nice as well and the touch sensor feature on the headphone is self was unexpected but amazing! Make sure you stretch out your pair incase it fits uncomfortably but other then that, I love these headphones."
Dan12345,2,Had to return,8/17/2022,And the three model and that was really good until it broke. And then for my birthday I thought I’d get the five model since it was like the best in class. But using it to mow the yard it would noise cancel and then about 10 minutes later it would go back off again for about 10 or 15 minutes and then back on again. And when using it at home to black out kid noises or grandkid noises it never really seem to block out much that I could tell and so my Apple AirPod pros I’ll just have to live with those.
BashNaz,5,Best noise canceling headphone,2/14/2023,"I've used many earbuds and headphones from various brands including Bose, Bowers and Wilkins, Sennheiser and apple. So far the best noise canceling I've ever experienced is with the Sony WH-1000XMS. Excellent for travel. Amazing sound quality as well."
Estefany,4,The coolest features,9/17/2022,"I bought these over a month ago and definitely have to say, they have the coolest features. Comparing to the AirPod Pro max headset … and the price of it —- to these Sony headphones- Sony wins , it’s definitely worth it. Beats apples price , beats the basic apple features. However my head is pretty small and I wish it had more shorter adjustable features ; it’s definitely better than the Beats Solo 3 pro with the head size adjustment, not slippery and is more sturdy . I’m not the biggest fan of the power button nor the case , but the headphones alone, perform really well and the battery life is also a very nice plus !"
Whozyrdaddy,5,Everything it says it is!!,9/18/2022,"I have tried various noise cancelling earbuds and also various headphones, and returned them all. They just sounded like earbuds and headphones. Some sounded good but not noise cancelling, even other Sony products! The WH1000XM5B has excellent tonal qualities and the noise cancellation really works! The fit and feel is also very comfortable!"
Anon,5,Great product,6/29/2023,I am overjoyed by the way these work. Simply awesome
Ren2,5,Great but be careful.,6/15/2022,Bought them to replace 1000xm4's that started whistling in my left ear. They are easier to pair and volume and ambient sound controls are improved. Needed a set with good noise canceling.
HRichiez,5,Amazing Headphones,8/2/2022,I upgraded from the XM4 and it was worth every penny. The noise cancellation is amazing. The sound quality superb. Nothing but the best.
Harsha,1,Bad headset,6/11/2022,I tried to connect to two devices and it didn't work. I tried to speak to multiple reps. Could not resolve. So I returned the product.
CHINTU,5,good,12/7/2023,except travel friendly it serves rest purposes
Depell,5,Amazing!,10/4/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I hate flying, had to take a plane for work. So I decided to splurge and get me a new pair of noise canceling headphones. After some research and hundreds or reviews read I end up with Sony's and I couldn't be happier. They knocked out all noise on the flight and I was able to make it to work no problem so happy with this product!"
Morganss,5,The best wireless headphones,10/26/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are hands down the best wireless headphones I have ever used. They make you feel completely immersed in what you are listening to. I love that they cancel noise but don't completely cancel everything so you can still be aware of your surroundings. They are super comfortable and don't squeeze my head at all. They were super easy to sync to my phone as well. I am absolutely obsessed with these head phones.
Anon,5,Fantastic Sound,10/10/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones are absolutely outstanding. This is my first experience with noise canceling headphones and the sound is crystal clear and I have no annoying outside side. You literally don't hear anything else except for what's coming through the headphones. Additionally, I am computer challenged and didn't have any troubles hooking up through bluetooth. It wasn't complicated and I was able to do it with little assistance! Lastly, the comfort level is amazing. They feel great and I can wear them for hours. The charge also lasts for 30 hours and a 3 minute charge gives you 3 hours of time. How fantastic is that?!? I can't wait to take them on my next long plane ride."
Timothy6585,5,Amazing!!,10/11/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These sony wireless noise canceling headphones are absolutely amazing. These headphones really rock my world. They have no issues connecting to my phone. The music is super loud and comes through very clear. They are very comfortable and are most definitely the best at noise canceling. You have the ability to turn the noise canceling off even. Just by slightly rubbing your finger on the side of the headphone you can change the volume and change song/fast forward/rewind. Also my favorite feature is that they stop playing if you take them off your head and automatically resumes once you put them back on.
deb2020,5,love this,10/5/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love this so much. Love the fact you can touch the side of the headphones and the music stops playing you touch them again music starts. Only down flaw is the charging cable is short wish it was a little longer but other than that is are wonderful headphones. Good for kids on long car ride same as for adults. Came with a wonderful case. So you can't loose anything at all.
Winter,5,Peace in a noisy world,10/5/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The noise canceling on these is absolutely amazing. I live in a house with a lot of noise, and these headphones give me such a feeling of peace. I can't hear the fan, window A/C, air purifier, and all the other similar noises with these on. That's without music playing. The audio quality is out of this world and I don't believe I'll ever be able to listen to music any other way ever again."
bubblegod123,5,Awesome headphones!,10/7/2022,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this a month ago and I'm so happy that I did! The Sony wireless noise canceling headphones deliver great sound quality and I love listening to music around the house. I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for quality headphones!
Anon,5,Awesome Headphones,12/23/2022,These headphones are the best. I'm upgrading from bose qc35 and these are great. Comfy cushions and greats sound.
Shellyjo,5,Great Features,10/7/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love these awesome Sony headphones, light,feel great and the bass is amazing,I highly recommend them to everyone, Best noise cancelling I've ever had,they are so great,love them."
Alphamalemaverick5,5,Makes me transcend time and space,6/29/2022,I feel like Dr. Manhattan when I'm wearing these. Out of body experience every time they come in contact with my ears. (Use the app and look up the best EQ for the XM5 and then adjust from that for best sound quality). Battery is nigh eternal. Powered by Zeus himself.
Palto,5,Awesome,6/11/2022,These headphones blow the AirPod Max headphones out of the water. They're more comfortable and lighter than the last Sonys in this line-up. They also fixed the connectivity issue where it's a breeze to connect to a different device. Highly recommended and worth the price.
Pastorptcc,5,Love them,9/30/2022,"I bought these about a month ago because I deal with tinnitus I need a good noise canceling headphones. These are amazing, best headphones I've ever had."
Mathis,1,Wasn't working,1/10/2024,Wasn't working
Lynn,1,It didnt last,1/18/2024,Gave it to my son for Christmas and already not working. Have to try to get it replaced.
dustinw,5,Industry-leading noise canceling,6/14/2022,"This model of headphones seems to continue to be the best in class in all areas. The superb noise canceling, great audio quality and excellent features easily put it in front of all other models. I use these for trips and while I work in the office, and they are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time and have become a must for me on plane rides, with their noise canceling. I can't recommend these enough."
Grlg33k,5,Wow... audio heaven!,8/31/2022,"The best set I have ever owned. The sound quality is amazing. The comfort is top notch, even while wearing glasses and earrings! The noise canceling is fantastic. The battery life has been great too. Love these so much!"
DoubleAA,5,Great quality headphones!!!,1/28/2024,"I bought these a month ago and love them! My Beats headphones snapped trying to put them on my head and I never feel that fear when I'm about to put them on so love the design. The sound quality is really good with the exception of max volume (those around you can hear) but for your hearing, you probably shouldn't listen to anything at max volume. Since buying these I've worn them to work out, commute in, and listen to music while I work. Overall, I would recommend these to anyone looking for good noise-cancelling headphones."
Kunal_P,4,Expected to have better noise cancellation,8/10/2023,"The noise cancellation was not upto the expectation but sound quality was spot on. Really love the sound quality of sony products. If you really are a music enthusiast, the sound quality will elevate your experience. Can't say the same about any other products on the market. And the Bass boost is something that you should try on these sony and it speaks for itself. And they're comfortable. I hope they get cheaper so more people can try it out."
TonenoT,5,Simply the best Noise Canceling Headphone,8/12/2023,"This is simply the best Noise Cancelling Headphones on the market. I use Noise Cancelling headphones as a pilot and these have even better sound quality, then my more super expensive Aviation ones. That sound quality is top notch, love the low lows and the clear highs. This is simple Top Sony that used to lead the tech industry years ago."
Levi,5,Perfect,12/29/2023,"Easily the best pair of headphones I've used within the price range. Don't expect the noise canceling to be dead silent because that's impossible, but it's definitely one of the best I've ever gotten from over-ear headphones."
SoundHound10658,5,Full featured with excellent noise cancelation,6/29/2023,"I've used these for 3 months now almost every day, and I couldn't be happier. First. the noise cancellation is excellent. The sound fidelity is superb. These are full of useful features, or if you don't like too many features and want them to be simple, you can turn those features off. 1) Has a touch pad on the ear that makes is so simply to swipe my finger forward or backward to skip songs, or swipe up or down to adjust the volume. If you inadvertently hit the touch pad with your hand, you will usually accidentally tap it only once, and one tap is a non-operational tap sequence so all it does does is beep. 2) Has a speak to chat feature. If you start speaking, the sound will mute (or pause, I can't remember which). You can adjust the sensitivity in the app on your phone. The app, by the way, is excellent. Someone finally made a decent configuration app. 3) If you want to immediately hear something, like an announcement on a train, just hold your palm against the right earpiece/touchpad. Let go when you're ready to go into your silent cocoon and listen to music again. 4) Adjust equalization with a separate bass boost function. This works very well, and it doesn't seem to noticeably affect battery life. In fact, with all of these features, I'd expect the battery life to be poor, but it's not. They're rated at 30 hours, and I'm getting at least 20, and probably more like 25 hours. 5) One of the settings allows ambient noise to come in so you can hear your surroundings. There are two settings available for how much ambient noise can come in. This is for when you might be walking or running in a busy environment and need to have some awareness of your surroundings. The headphones will detect if you're sitting still (activates full noise cancelling), walking (activates letting in a low level of ambient noise), running (activates higher level of ambient noise), riding transit (full noise cancellation). You can turn off the automatic switching if you don't like it. You do this in the app. 6) Alternatively, based on location, it will adjust it's mode of how much ambient noise it lets in. You specify the location (it uses your phones location system and a map), or it will suggest locations for those that you frequently go to. This feature I think drained my phone battery very fast. After I turned off location detection, my phone battery use was normal again. I can't believe how much engineering went into these phones and how much time was spent making that companion app actually useful and highly functional. Sony rocked it on these headphones. I can't imagine there's a better pair out there. I chose these over Bose, and I'm gladd I did, although I don't have Bose, so I can't compare them. These were rated as having better noise cancelling technology (they kept out more noise than Bose) according to the study I read and graphs I viewed. You won't get the features in the Bose headphones, but you'll no doubt like those as well. If you want features, these are the headphones for you. Oh, yes. All of that effort you put into configuring the app? Guess what? You can set it to automatically back up your settings to Sony. I used an existing account I had with Sony that I set up for my Blue-ray player years ago."
JonfromCB,5,"Great headphones, but...",8/2/2023,Case is too big inconvenient to carry around. App has lots of good features but it's not intuitive and it doesn't work on PCs.....really?
shelby,5,AMAZING,11/10/2023,"Best headphones ever, so comfy, can't hear anything when I have them on besides what's going on with my music it's awesome"
rhonalds,5,Lots of Features with these headphones and APP,6/28/2023,"I got these Excellent upgrade from my old 1000's. Better sound, better noise cancelling. Better Ambient sound. These were so good, I got the WF1000XM4 earbuds for Father's Day!"
Anon,5,Great quality,10/6/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love them. Loud and comfortable. Also let's you hear the background if you want to. My daughter needs earphones for school and this one are awesome. Came in a so pretty bag, Love these headphones. Great quality. Soft & comfortable on the ears."
pam8358,5,ms,10/5/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a headphone investment. The prices are comparable to others in this catagory. The packaging is a sturdy cardboard nesting box and the headphones itself are in a secure slim profile pouch. The instructions are easily accessible via a camera scan or on the web. It takes a bit of time to update the software and compete setup so be sure to allow for that. The headphones pair easily. They are adjustable and very comfortable over your ears. They can detect when you sit, walk, etc and adjust the sound accordingly. The sound quality is excellent. They are available in black or silver. They fold easily for storage in their case. I have not tried them for hands free calling yet but understand this is a feature of the product. This is definitely a product to consider!"
paul,1,Terrible seller don't buy,11/8/2023,"Fake product sent, this seller is terrible"
raraboom,5,Best Headphones,8/30/2023,I am so happy I bought this! Boosted my Productivity at the office!
Anon,5,Great noise reduction,6/29/2023,"I have been using these headphones for a couple of months, they're comfortable the battery charge lasts for ever and the noise reduction is great."
Dani OJ,4,Great,8/12/2022,I don’t know where to start but to general description of this headphone is that it’s great and superb. I first had the XM4 but this is way better in all things except and I repeat except the volume level is not that high to my expectations and as compared to the Apple headphones. The volume level is why I gave it a 4 star.
Kalisi11,3,"Not that great, esp for the price",7/21/2022,Super fancy super lightweight have to download apps and takes a forever installation set up where supposedly you wear it and it adjusts to the shape of your ear? The bass is missing the treble sucks and the studio beats are way better. It also glitches- a lot.
Honeybadger,5,"Superb sound quality, awesome sound deafening",2/16/2023,"The sound is superb, the noise cancelling awesome. The headphones are light and comfortable. All the features built in like pause, volume control and advancing music are easy to use. One touch to check headphone battery life is sweet! The battery life is phenomenal and charging time very quick."
BigDadE76,5,Amazing,6/20/2022,"I've had my headphones for about a month and they sound great!!! Noise cancelation works wonderfully when you have it on, when you turn it off you can actually hear people better than you can with the headphones off and your head. I've been recommending these headphones to everyone i talk to, so Beats headphones no more for me, great product Sony..."
Rahma18,5,Works well with iphone,12/4/2022,"I just bought it, at first it said that some features won't work with iPhone, but after I tried it, everything works well. The only feature that I still considered installing later, it's Alexa. Since this device only works with Alexa for the voice command. I hope the product will be able to update so that the user can use Google and Siri."
Axboh92,4,Awesome Sound; Headphone App Sucks,10/30/2022,"I'm going to start by saying that these headphones rock. I love the minimalist design, no logos all over the place either. The noise canceling is great, I barely hear anything around me. The bad thing is the app and features. I feel like I'm looking at an app from 2015. Take note from Samsung on their equalizer placement, the menu style needs work, and why are there 3 apps for one pair of headphones? The UI isn't very user friendly and setting up apps for 360 audio really sucks."
MDHEXT,5,Best in class Consumer Grade headphones,6/21/2022,"The Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones are a great step up from the XM4 in terns of Noise Cancellation, Call Quality, and Sound Quality. However, in what it gained, it also lost some of its portability compared to the previous generation and it's slightly less comfortable. After around 30-40 minutes of use, the headphones start making my ears hurt, likely due to the smaller sized earcups. In terms of portability, the bulk of the new case makes it harder to stash away than their predecessor. And in terms of wearability, it's easy to dirty the inside of the earcup when wearing the headphones around your neck if you're eating. As someone who loves wearing the headphones around my neck, I prefer the previous generation's (Sony WH-1000XM4) to have the earups rotate the operational end of the cup inward against my body so that the drivers and inside cup don't get damaged if I spill something or food lands on the headphones while they're on my neck. Another issue I have is the absence of quick pair via NFC which I utilized heavily on the previous WH-1000XM4. The lack of the feature on the XM5s is more inconvinient as it means I have to go into my phone's bluetooth settings to connect to the headphones after using them with my laptop. This, however, is where the XM5 really improved, making switching between devices easier as it immidietly connects to the device I'm switching to while disconnecting the device I was using almost immediately. This was a welcome addition to the headphones and it alleviates the problems I had with the removal of NFC pairing/connecting."
Naqvib,5,Excellent Sound Quality,6/28/2023,I bought it almost 5-6 months ago. It has excellent sound and good features
mohanymous,2,Unreliable performance with my MacBook,6/14/2022,I've almost given up! I'm very disappointed with the the utter lack of basic functionality: Microsoft Teams and this headset are not inspiring confidence.
jjenkins,3,Sounds good but,8/31/2022,The headphones sound great but they keep turning or disconnecting. It happens several times every time I use them and it seems to be getting worse
Goldenone,5,Absolutely amazing noise canceling headphones,10/20/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony 1000XM5 Noise Canceling Headphones are truly amazing. The sound quality is like no other it's crystal clear and you really can hear the acoustics unlike other headphones. They are light weight and fit very comfortably on my head the ear cushions don't smush my ears. The battery life is another wonderful feature, the headphones can last me days before needing to be charged. The noise canceling aspect is perfect you can't hear a thing when they are on. This is great when you want to tune out or have to focus on something and can't be distracted. Sony these are amazing!!"
